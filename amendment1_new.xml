            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874137616"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874136080"/>Madison’s original proposal for a bill of rights provision concerning religion read: “<quotedText>The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretence, infringed.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080001"/> The language was altered in the House to read: “<quotedText>Congress shall make no law establishing religion, or to prevent the free exercise thereof, or to infringe the rights of conscience.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080005"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874136080"/> In the Senate, the section adopted read: “<quotedText>Congress shall make no law establishing articles of faith, or a mode of worship, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion. . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080009"/> It was in the conference committee of the two bodies, chaired by Madison, that the present language was written with its somewhat more indefinite “<quotedText>respecting</quotedText>” phraseology.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080013"/> Debate in Congress lends little assistance in interpreting the religion clauses; Madison’s position, as well as that of Jefferson, who influenced him, is fairly clear,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080017"/> but the intent, insofar as there was one, of the others in Congress who voted for the language and those in the states who voted to ratify is subject to speculation.</p>
            <note role="topic">
              <heading>Scholarly Commentary</heading>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874137616"/>The explication of the religion clauses by scholars in the nineteenth century gave a restrained sense of their meaning. Story, who thought that “<quotedText>the right of a society or government to interfere in matters of religion will hardly be contested by any persons, who believe that piety, religion, and morality are intimately connected with the well being of the state, and indispensable to the administration of civil justice,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080021"/> looked upon the prohibition simply as an exclusion from the Federal Government of all power to act upon the subject. “<quotedText>The situation . . . of the different states equally proclaimed the policy, as well as the necessity of such an exclusion. In some of the states, episcopalians constituted the predominant sect; in others presbyterians; in others, congregationalists; in others, quakers; and in others again, there was a close numerical rivalry among contending sects. It was impossible, that there should not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousy on the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if the national government were left free to create a religious establishment. The only security was in extirpating the power. But this alone would have been an imperfect security, if it had not been followed up by a declaration of the right of the free exercise of religion, and a prohibition (as we have seen) of all religious tests. Thus, the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions; and the Catholic and the Protestant, the Calvinist and the Arminian, the Jew and the Infidel, may sit down at the common table of the national councils, without any inquisition into their faith, or mode of worship.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080025"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874137616"/>Not until the Supreme Court held the religion clauses applicable to the states in the 1940s<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51874091600"/> did it have much opportunity to interpret them. But it quickly gave them a broad construction. In<inline role="name" class="case"> Everson v.

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874137616"/>More recent decisions, however, evidence a narrower interpretation of the religion clauses.

              <heading>Court Tests Applied to Legislation Affecting Religion</heading>
              <p>Before considering in detail the development of the two religion clauses by the Supreme Court, one should notice briefly the tests the Court has articulated to adjudicate the religion cases. At the same time it should be emphasized that the Court has noted that the language of earlier cases “<quotedText>may have [contained] too sweeping utterances on aspects of these clauses that seemed clear in relation to the particular cases but have limited meaning as general principles.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080049"/> While later cases have relied on a series of well-defined, if difficult-to-apply, tests, the Court has cautioned that “<quotedText>the purpose [of the religion clauses] was to state an objective, not to write a statute.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080053"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874052944"/>In 1802, President Jefferson wrote a letter to a group of Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut, in which he declared that it was the purpose of the First Amendment to build “<quotedText>a wall of separation between Church and State.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080057"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Reynolds v. United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080061"/> Chief Justice Waite for the Court characterized the phrase as “<quotedText>almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment.</quotedText>” In its first encounters with religion-based challenges to state programs, the Court looked to Jefferson’s metaphor for substantial guidance.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080065"/> But a metaphor may obscure as well as illuminate, and the Court soon began to emphasize neutrality and voluntarism as the standard of restraint on governmental action.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080069"/>The concept of neutrality itself is “<quotedText>a coat of many colors,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080073"/> and three standards that seemingly could be stated in objective fashion emerged as tests of Establishment Clause validity. <marker role="index" misc="idm51874013472"/>The first two standards emerged together. “<quotedText>The test may be stated as follows: what are the purpose and the primary effect of the enactment? If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion then the enactment exceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the Constitution. That is to say that to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080077"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874008624"/> The third test emerged several years later and asks whether the governmental program results in “<quotedText>an excessive government entanglement with religion. The test is inescapably one of degree . . . [T]he questions are whether the involvement is excessive, and whether it is a continuing one calling for official and continuing surveillance leading to an impermissible degree of entanglement.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080081"/> In 1971, these three tests were combined and restated in Chief Justice Burger’s opinion for the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon v. Kurtzman</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080085"/> and are frequently referred to by reference to that case name.<marker role="index" misc="idm51874052944"/></p>

Other tests, however, have also been formulated and used. Justice Kennedy has proffered “<quotedText>coercion</quotedText>” as an alternative test for violations of the Establishment Clause,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873909728"/> and the Court has used that test as the basis for decision from time to time.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873904928"/> But that test has been criticized on the grounds that it would eliminate a principal distinction between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause and make the former a “<quotedText>virtual nullity.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873900368"/> Justice O’Connor has suggested “<quotedText>endorsement</quotedText>” as a clarification of the <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline> test; <i>i.e.</i>, that the Establishment Clause is violated if the government intends its action to endorse or disapprove of religion or if a “<quotedText>reasonable observer</quotedText>” would perceive the government’s action as such an endorsement or disapproval.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873892640"/> But others have criticized that test as too amorphous to provide adequate guidance.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873886720"/> Justice O’Connor has also suggested that it may be inappropriate to try to shoehorn all Establishment Clause cases into one test, and has called instead for recognition that different contexts may call for different approaches.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873882112"/> In two Establishment Clause decisions, the Court employed all three tests in one decision<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873879536"/> and relied primarily on a modified version of the <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline> tests in the other.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873876384"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874008624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874013472"/></p>
              <p>In interpreting and applying the Free Exercise Clause, the Court has consistently held religious beliefs to be absolutely immune from governmental interference.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873870160"/> But it has used a number of standards to review government action restrictive of religiously motivated conduct, ranging from formal neutrality<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873864304"/> to clear and present danger<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873859664"/> to strict scrutiny.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873857472"/> For cases of intentional governmental discrimination against religion, the Court still employs strict scrutiny<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873852208"/> But for most other free exercise cases it has now reverted to a standard of formal neutrality. “<quotedText>[T]he right of free exercise,</quotedText>” it has stated, “<quotedText>does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873848656"/></p>

Schisms sometimes develop within churches or between a local church and the general church, resulting in secession or expulsion of one faction or of the local church. A dispute over which body is to control the property of the church will then often be taken into the courts. It is now established that both religion clauses prevent governmental inquiry into religious doctrine in settling such disputes, and instead require courts simply to look to the decision-making body or process in the church and to give effect to whatever decision is officially and properly made.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873842448"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873841136"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873839840"/>The first such case was <inline role="name" class="case">Watson v. Jones</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080125"/> which was decided on common-law grounds in a diversity action without explicit reliance on the First Amendment. A constitutionalization of the rule was made in <inline role="name" class="case">Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080129"/> in which the Court held unconstitutional a state statute that recognized the autonomy and authority of those North American branches of the Russian Orthodox Church that had declared their independence from the general church. Recognizing that <inline role="name" class="case">Watson v. Jones</inline> had been decided on nonconstitutional grounds, the Court thought nonetheless that the opinion “<quotedText>radiates . . . a spirit of freedom for religious organizations, and independence from secular control or manipulation – in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080133"/> The power of civil courts to resolve church property disputes was severely circumscribed, the Court held, because to permit resolution of doctrinal disputes in court was to jeopardize First Amendment values. What a court must do, it held, is to look at the church rules: if the church is a hierarchical one that reposes determination of ecclesiastical issues in a certain body, the resolution by that body is determinative, whereas if the church is a congregational one that prescribes action by a majority vote, that determination will prevail.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080137"/> On the other hand, a court confronted with a church property dispute could apply “<quotedText>neutral principles of law, developed for use in all property disputes,</quotedText>” when to do so would not require resolution of doctrinal issues.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080141"/> In a 1976 case, the Court elaborated on the limits of proper inquiry, holding that an argument over a matter of internal church government – the power to reorganize the dioceses of a hierarchical church in this country – was “<quotedText>at the core of ecclesiastical affairs</quotedText>” and a court could not interpret the church constitution to make an independent determination of the power but must defer to the interpretation of the church body authorized to decide.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080145"/></p>

Wolf</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080149"/> however, a divided Court, while formally adhering to these principles, appeared to depart in substance from their application. A schism had developed in a local church that was a member of a hierarchical church, and the majority voted to withdraw from the general church. The proper authority of the general church determined that the minority constituted the “<quotedText>true congregation</quotedText>”of the local church and awarded them authority over it. But rather than requiring deference to the decision of the church body, the Court approved the approach of the state court in applying neutral principles by examining the deeds to the church property, state statutes, and provisions of the general church’s constitution concerning ownership and control of church property in order to determine that no language of trust in favor of the general church was contained in any of them and that the property thus belonged to the local congregational majority.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080153"/> Further, the Court held, the First Amendment did not prevent the state court from applying a presumption of majority rule to award control to the majority of the local congregation, provided that it permitted defeasance of the presumption upon a showing that the identity of the local church is to be determined by some other means as expressed perhaps in the general church charter.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080157"/> The dissent argued that to permit a court narrowly to view only the church documents relating to property ownership permitted it to ignore the fact that the dispute was over ecclesiastical matters and that the general church had decided which faction of the congregation was the local church.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080161"/></p>

Wolf</inline> restated the rule that it is improper to review an ecclesiastical dispute and that deference is required in those cases, but, by approving a neutral principles inquiry which in effect can filter out the doctrinal issues underlying a church dispute, the Court seems to have approved at least an indirect limitation of the authority of hierarchical churches.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080165"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873842448"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873841136"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873839840"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873746608"/>The Court’s first opportunity to rule on the validity of governmental financial assistance to a religiously affiliated institution occurred in 1899, the assistance being a federal grant for the construction of a wing of a hospital owned and operated by a Roman Catholic order that was to be devoted to the care of the poor. The Court viewed the hospital primarily as a secular institution so chartered by Congress and not as a religious or sectarian body, and thus avoided the constitutional issue.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080177"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873730000"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873728544"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873727232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873725904"/>But, when the right of local authorities to provide free transportation for children attending parochial schools reached the Court, it adopted a very broad view of the restrictions imposed by the Establishment Clause. “<quotedText>The ‘establishment of religion’ clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and<i xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between church and State.'</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080181"/></p>

Although recognizing that “<quotedText>it approaches the verge</quotedText>” of the state’s constitutional power, Justice Black found that the transportation was a form of “<quotedText>public welfare legislation</quotedText>” that was being extended “<quotedText>to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080185"/>“<quotedText>It is undoubtedly true that children are helped to get to church schools.

Books are furnished at the request of the pupil and ownership remains, at least technically, in the state. Thus no funds or books are furnished to parochial schools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not to schools. Perhaps free books make it more likely that some children choose to attend a sectarian school, but that was true of the state-paid bus fares in <i>Everson</i> and does not alone demonstrate an unconstitutional degree of support for a religious institution.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080205"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873691264"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873743936"/></p>

Through the 1970s, at least, the law became as restrictive in fact as the dicta in the early cases suggested, except for the provision of some assistance to children under the “<quotedText>child benefit</quotedText>” theory. Since that time, the Court has gradually adopted a more accommodating approach. It has upheld direct aid programs that have been of only marginal benefit to the religious mission of the recipient elementary and secondary schools, tax benefit and scholarship aid programs where the schools have received the assistance as the result of the independent decisions of the parents or students who initially receive the aid, and in its most recent decisions direct aid programs which substantially benefit the educational function of such schools. Indeed, in its most recent decisions the Court has overturned several of the most restrictive school aid precedents from its earlier jurisprudence. Throughout, the Court has allowed greater discretion with respect to aid programs benefiting religiously affiliated colleges and social services agencies.<marker role="index" misc="idm51873703984"/></p>

There are adequate legitimate, non-sectarian bases for legislation to assist nonpublic, religious schools: preservation of a healthy and safe educational environment for all school children, promotion of pluralism and diversity among public and nonpublic schools, and prevention of overburdening of the public school system that would accompany the financial failure of private schools.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080209"/></p>

As a consequence, the Court’s applications of these tests have not always been consistent, and the rules guiding their application have not always been easy to decipher. Moreover, in its most recent decisions the Court has substantially modified the strictures these tests have previously imposed on public aid to pervasively sectarian entities.</p>

The Establishment Clause “<quotedText>absolutely prohibit[s] government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873633456"/> The government may provide direct support to the secular services and programs sponsored by religious entities, but it cannot directly subsidize such organizations’ religious activities or proselytizing.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873629936"/> Thus, the Court struck down as unconstitutional a program providing grants for the maintenance and repair of sectarian elementary and secondary school facilities, because the grants had no restrictions to prevent their use for such purposes as defraying the costs of building or maintaining chapels or classrooms in which religion is taught.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873624208"/> It also struck down a program subsidizing field trip transportation for children attending sectarian elementary and secondary schools, because field trips are inevitably interwoven with the schools’ educational functions.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873620848"/></p>

The initial beneficiaries of the public aid must be determined on the basis of religiously neutral criteria, and they must have a genuine choice about whether to use the aid at sectarian or nonsectarian entities. But, where those standards have been met, the Court has upheld indirect aid programs even though the sectarian institutions that ultimately benefit may use the aid for religious purposes. <marker role="index" misc="idm51873608704"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873607392"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873606976"/>Moreover, the Court has gradually broadened its understanding of what constitutes a genuine choice so that now most voucher or tax benefit programs benefiting the parents of children attending sectarian schools seem able to pass constitutional muster.</p>

Organizations that are permeated by a religious purpose and character in all that they do have often been held by the Court to be constitutionally ineligible for direct public aid. Direct aid to religion-dominated institutions inevitably violates the primary effect test, the Court has said, because such aid generally cannot be limited to secular use in such entities and, as a consequence, it has a primary effect of advancing religion.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873564736"/> Moreover, any effort to limit the use of public aid by such entities to secular use inevitably falls afoul of the excessive entanglement test, according to the Court, because the risk of diversion of the aid to religious use is so great that it necessitates an intrusive government monitoring.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873555360"/> But, direct aid to religious entities that are not pervasively sectarian, the Court held, is constitutionally permissible, because the secular functions of such entities can be distinguished from their religious ones for purposes of public aid and because the risk of diversion of the aid to religious use is attenuated and does not require an intrusive government monitoring. As a practical matter, this distinction has had its most serious consequences for programs providing aid directly to sectarian elementary and secondary schools, because the Court has, until recently, presumed such schools to be pervasively sectarian and direct aid, as a consequence, to be severely limited.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873549040"/> The Court has presumed to the contrary with respect to religiously affiliated colleges, hospitals, and social services providers; and as a consequence it has found direct aid programs to such entities to be permissible.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873547504"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Agostini v. Felton</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873528624"/> the Court, in a 5-4 decision, abandoned the presumptions that public school teachers giving instruction on the premises of sectarian elementary and secondary schools will be so affected by the religiosity of the environment that they will inculcate religion and that, consequently, an excessively entangling monitoring of their services is constitutionally necessary. In <inline role="name" class="case">Mitchell v. Helms</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873525968"/> in turn, the Court abandoned the presumptions that such schools are so pervasively sectarian that their secular educational functions cannot be differentiated from their religious educational functions and that direct aid to their educational functions, consequently, violates the Establishment Clause. In reaching these conclusions and upholding the aid programs in question, the Court overturned its prior decision in <inline role="name" class="case">Aguilar v.

Kurtzman</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080257"/> The Court struck down two state statutes, one of which authorized the “<quotedText>purchase</quotedText>” of secular educational services from nonpublic elementary and secondary schools, a form of reimbursement for the cost to religious schools of the teaching of such things as mathematics, modern foreign languages, and physical sciences, and the other of which provided salary supplements to nonpublic school teachers who taught courses similar to those found in public schools, used textbooks approved for use in public schools, and agreed not to teach any classes in religion. Accepting the secular purpose attached to both statutes by the legislature, the Court did not pass on the secular effect test, but found excessive entanglement. This entanglement arose because the legislature “<quotedText>has not, and could not, provide state aid on the basis of a mere assumption that secular teachers under religious discipline can avoid conflicts. The State must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion . . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080261"/> Because the schools concerned were religious schools, because they were under the control of the church hierarchy, and because the primary purpose of the schools was the propagation of the faith, a “<quotedText>comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that these restrictions [on religious use of aid] are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080265"/> Moreover, the provision of public aid inevitably will draw religious conflict into the public arena as the contest for adequate funding goes on. Thus, the Court held, both programs were unconstitutional because the state supervision necessary to ensure a secular purpose and a secular effect inevitably involved the state authorities too deeply in the religious affairs of the aided institutions.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080269"/></p>

This holding was based on the fact that 75 percent of the qualifying schools were church-related or religiously affiliated educational institutions, and that the assistance was available without regard to the degree of religious activity of the schools. The materials and equipment loaned were religiously neutral, but the substantial assistance necessarily constituted aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole and thus had a primary effect of advancing religion.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080277"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873469616"/> Second, the provision of auxiliary services – remedial and accelerated instruction, guidance counseling and testing, speech and hearing services – by public employees on nonpublic school premises was invalidated because the Court found that, even though the teachers under this program – unlike those under one of the programs struck down in <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon v. Kurtzman</inline> – were public employees rather than employees of the religious schools, the continuing surveillance necessary to ensure that the teachers remained religiously neutral gave rise to a constitutionally intolerable degree of entanglement between church and state.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080281"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Grand Rapids School District v. Ball</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080285"/> the Court invalidated two programs conducted in leased private school classrooms, one taught during the regular school day by public school teachers,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080289"/>and the other taught after regular school hours by part-time “<quotedText>public</quotedText>” teachers otherwise employed as full-time teachers by the sectarian school.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080293"/>Both programs, the Court held, had the effect of promoting religion in three distinct ways. The teachers might be influenced by the “<quotedText>pervasively sectarian nature</quotedText>” of the environment and might “<quotedText>subtly or overtly indoctrinate the students in particular religious tenets at public expense</quotedText>”; use of the parochial school classrooms “<quotedText>threatens to convey a message of state support for religion</quotedText>” through “<quotedText>the symbolic union of government and religion in one sectarian enterprise</quotedText>”; and “<quotedText>the programs in effect subsidize the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a substantial portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080297"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Aguilar v.

The program differed from those at issue in <inline role="name" class="case">Grand Rapids</inline> because the classes were closely monitored for religious content. This “<quotedText>pervasive monitoring</quotedText>” did not save the program, however, because, by requiring close cooperation and day-to-day contact between public and secular authorities, the monitoring “<quotedText>infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of excessive entanglement.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080305"/></p>

Several different forms of assistance to students were at issue in <inline role="name" class="case">Wolman v.

In two rulings, the Court reversed course with respect to the constitutionality of public school personnel's providing educational services on the premises of pervasively sectarian schools. First, in <inline role="name" class="case">Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873330144"/> the Court held that the public subsidy of a sign-language interpreter for a deaf student attending a parochial school created no primary effect or entanglement problems. The payment did not relieve the school of an expense that it would otherwise have borne, the Court stated, and the interpreter had no role in selecting or editing the content of any of the lessons. Reviving the child benefit theory of its earlier cases, the Court wrote: “<quotedText>The service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled’ under the IDEA, without regard to the ‘sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child attends.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873328992"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873703984"/></p>

Felton</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873317616"/> overturned its decision in <inline role="name" class="case">Aguilar v.

Decisions such as <inline role="name" class="case">Zobrest</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Witters v. Washington Department of Social Services</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873307168"/> it said, had repudiated the notions that the placement of a public employee in a sectarian school creates an “<quotedText>impermissible symbolic link</quotedText>” between government and religion, that “<quotedText>all government aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools</quotedText>” is constitutionally forbidden, that public teachers in a sectarian school necessarily pose a serious risk of inculcating religion, and that “<quotedText>pervasive monitoring of [such] teachers is required.</quotedText>” The proper criterion under the primary effect prong of the <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline> test, the Court asserted, is religious neutrality, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, whether “<quotedText>aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873301696"/> Finding the Title I program to meet that test, the Court concluded that “<quotedText>accordingly, we must acknowledge that <inline role="name" class="case">Aguilar</inline>, as well as the portion of <inline role="name" class="case">Ball</inline> addressing Grand Rapids’ Shared Time program, are no longer good law.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873292608"/></p>

At issue in the case was a federal program that distributed funds to local educational agencies to provide instructional materials and equipment, such as computer hardware and software, library books, movie projectors, television sets, VCRs, laboratory equipment, maps, and cassette recordings, to public and private elementary and secondary schools. Virtually identical programs had previously been held unconstitutional by the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Meek v.

The opinions of Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Kennedy, and of Justice O’Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, found the program constitutional. They agreed that to pass muster under the primary effect prong of the <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline>test direct public aid has to be secular in nature and distributed on the basis of religiously neutral criteria. They also agreed, in contrast to past rulings, that sectarian elementary and secondary schools should not be deemed constitutionally ineligible for direct aid on the grounds that their secular educational functions are “<quotedText>inextricably intertwined</quotedText>” with their religious educational functions, <i>i.e.</i>, that they are pervasively sectarian. But their rationales for the program’s constitutionality then diverged. For Justice Thomas it was sufficient that the instructional materials were secular in nature and were distributed according to neutral criteria. It made no difference whether the schools used the aid for purposes of religious indoctrination or not. But that was not sufficient for Justice O’Connor. She adhered to the view that direct public aid has to be limited to secular use by the recipient institutions. She further asserted that a limitation to secular use could be honored by the teachers in the sectarian schools and that the risk that the aid would be used for religious purposes was not so great as to require an intrusive and entangling government monitoring.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873264288"/></p>

Initially, the Court in 1973 struck down substantially similar programs in New York and Pennsylvania providing for tuition reimbursement to parents of religious school children. New York’s program provided reimbursements out of general tax revenues for tuition paid by low-income parents to send their children to nonpublic elementary and secondary schools; the reimbursements were of fixed amounts but could not exceed 50 percent of actual tuition paid. Pennsylvania provided fixed-sum reimbursement for parents who sent their children to nonpublic elementary and secondary schools, so long as the amount paid did not exceed actual tuition, the funds to be derived from cigarette tax revenues. Both programs, it was held, constituted public financial assistance to sectarian institutions with no attempt to segregate the benefits so that religion was not advanced.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080345"/></p>

This too was invalidated in <inline role="name" class="case">Nyquist</inline>. “<quotedText>In practical terms there would appear to be little difference, for purposes of determining whether such aid has the effect of advancing religion, between the tax benefit allowed here and the tuition [reimbursement] grant. . . . The qualifying parent under either program receives the same form of encouragement and reward for sending his children to nonpublic schools. The only difference is that one parent receives an actual cash payment while the other is allowed to reduce by an arbitrary amount the sum he would otherwise be obliged to pay over to the State. We see no answer to Judge Hays' dissenting statement below that '[i]n both instances the money involved represents a charge made upon the state for the purpose of religious education.'</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080349"/> Some difficulty, however, was experienced in distinguishing this program from the tax exemption approved in <inline role="name" class="case">Walz</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080353"/></p>

The first, in the New York case, was that the tuition reimbursement program promoted the free exercise of religion in that it permitted low-income parents desiring to send their children to school in accordance with their religious views to do so. The Court agreed that “<quotedText>tension inevitably exists between the Free Exercise and the Establishment Clauses,</quotedText>” but explained that the tension is ordinarily resolved through application of the “<quotedText>neutrality</quotedText>” principle: government may neither advance nor inhibit religion. The tuition program inescapably advanced religion and thereby violated this principle.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080357"/> The second subsidiary argument that the Court rejected was that, because the Pennsylvania program reimbursed parents who sent their children to nonsectarian schools as well as to sectarian ones, the portion respecting the former parents was valid and “<quotedText>parents of children who attended sectarian schools are entitled to the same aid as a matter of equal protection.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873199728"/> The Court found the argument “<quotedText>thoroughly spurious,</quotedText>” adding, “<quotedText>The Equal Protection Clause has never been regarded as a bludgeon with which to compel a State to violate other provisions of the Constitution.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080361"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Mueller v. Allen</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080365"/> the Court upheld a Minnesota deduction from state income tax available to parents of elementary and secondary school children for expenses incurred in providing tuition, transportation, textbooks, and various other school supplies. Because the Minnesota deduction was available to parents of public and private schoolchildren alike, the Court termed it “<quotedText>vitally different from the scheme struck down in <inline role="name" class="case">Nyquist</inline>,</quotedText>” and more similar to the benefits upheld in <inline role="name" class="case">Everson</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Allen</inline> as available to <i>all</i> schoolchildren.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080369"/> The Court declined to look behind the “<quotedText>facial neutrality</quotedText>” of the law and consider empirical evidence of its actual impact, citing a need for “<quotedText>certainty</quotedText>” and the lack of “<quotedText>principled standards</quotedText>” by which to evaluate such evidence.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080373"/>Also important to the Court’s refusal to consider the alleged disproportionate benefits to parents of parochial school children was the assertion that, “<quotedText>whatever unequal effect may be attributed to the statutory classification can fairly be regarded as a rough return for the benefits . . . provided to the State and all taxpayers by parents sending their children to parochial schools.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080377"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873730000"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873727232"/></p>

In the Court's view, therefore, the aid was “<quotedText>attenuated</quotedText>” rather than direct; because it was “<quotedText>available only as a result of decisions of individual parents,</quotedText>” there was no “<quotedText>imprimatur of state approval.</quotedText>”The Court noted that, with the exception of <inline role="name" class="case">Nyquist</inline>, “<quotedText>all . . . of our recent cases invalidating state aid to parochial schools have involved the direct transmission of assistance from the State to the schools themselves.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080381"/> Thus, <inline role="name" class="case">Mueller</inline> apparently stands for the proposition that state subsidies of tuition expenses at sectarian schools are permissible if contained in a facially neutral scheme providing benefits, at least nominally, to parents of public and private schoolchildren alike.</p>

Again, the Court emphasized that, in the vocational rehabilitation program “<quotedText>any aid provided is ‘made available without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited’</quotedText>” and “<quotedText>ultimately flows to religious institutions . . . only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873128512"/> The program, the Court stated, did not have the purpose of providing support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions; created no financial incentive for students to undertake religious education; and gave recipients “<quotedText>full opportunity to expend vocational rehabiiltation aid on wholly secular education.</quotedText>”“<quotedText>In this case,</quotedText>” the Court found, “<quotedText>the fact that the aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State.</quotedText>” Finally, the Court concluded, there was no evidence that “<quotedText>any significant portion of the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873125008"/></p>

The case involved the provision of a sign language interpreter pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873115920"/> to a deaf high school student who wanted to attend a Catholic high school. In upholding the assistance as constitutional, the Court emphasized that “<quotedText>[t]he service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled’ under the IDEA, without regard to the ‘sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child attends.</quotedText>” Thus, it held that the presence of the interpreter in the sectarian school resulted not from a decision of the state but from the “<quotedText>private decision of individual parents.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873112864"/></p>

Simmons-Harris</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873101712"/>the Court reinterpreted the genuine private choice criterion in a manner that seems to render most voucher programs constitutional. At issue was an Ohio program that provided vouchers to the parents of children in failing public schools in Cleveland for use at private schools in the city. The Court upheld the program notwithstanding that, as in <inline role="name" class="case">Nyquist</inline>, most of the schools at which the vouchers could be redeemed were religious and most of the voucher students attended such schools. But the Court found that the program nevertheless involved “<quotedText>true private choice.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873098800"/>“<quotedText>Cleveland schoolchildren,</quotedText>” the Court said, “<quotedText>enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school. That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause. The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating <i>all</i> options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51873097120"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873608704"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873607392"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873606976"/></p>

On the same day that it first struck down an assistance program for elementary and secondary private schools, the Court sustained construction grants to church-related colleges and universities.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080389"/> The specific grants in question were for the construction of two library buildings, a science building, a music, drama, and arts building, and a language laboratory. The law prohibited the financing of any facility for, or the use of any federally financed building for, religious purposes, although the restriction on use ran for only twenty years.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080393"/> The Court found that the purpose and effect of the grants were secular and that, unlike elementary and secondary schools, religious colleges were not so devoted to inculcating religion.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080397"/> The supervision required to ensure conformance with the non-religious-use requirement was found not to constitute “<quotedText>excessive entanglement,</quotedText>” inasmuch as a building is nonideological in character, and the construction grants were onetime rather than continuing.</p>

The Court did not decide whether this special form of assistance could be otherwise sustained, because it concluded that religion was neither advanced nor inhibited; nor was there any impermissible public entanglement. “<quotedText>Aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080401"/> The colleges involved, though affiliated with religious institutions, were not shown to be too pervasively religious – no religious qualifications existed for faculty or student body, a substantial part of the student body was not of the religion of the affiliation, and state rules precluded the use of any state-financed project for religious activities.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080405"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873087648"/></p>

The annual nature of the subsidy was recognized as posing the danger of political entanglement, but the plurality thought that the character of the aided institutions – “<quotedText>capable of separating secular and religious functions</quotedText>” – was more important.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080417"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873088928"/></p>

Kendrick</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080421"/> by a 5-4 vote, upheld the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA)<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080425"/> against facial challenge. The Act permits direct grants to religious organizations for the provision of health care and for counseling of adolescents on matters of pregnancy prevention and abortion alternatives, and requires grantees to involve other community groups, including religious organizations, in the delivery of services. All the Justices agreed that AFLA had valid secular purposes; their disagreement related to application of the effects and entanglement tests. The Court relied on analogy to the higher education cases rather than to the cases involving aid to elementary and secondary schools.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080429"/> The case presented conflicting factual considerations. On the one hand, the class of beneficiaries was broad, with religious groups not predominant among the wide range of eligible community organizations. On the other hand, there were analogies to the parochial school aid cases: secular and religious teachings might easily be mixed, and the age of the targeted group (adolescents) suggested susceptibility. The Court resolved these conflicts by holding that AFLA is facially valid, there being insufficient indication that a significant proportion of the AFLA funds would be disbursed to “<quotedText>pervasively sectarian</quotedText>” institutions, but by remanding to the district court to determine whether particular grants to pervasively sectarian institutions were invalid. The Court emphasized in both parts of its opinion that the fact that “<quotedText>views espoused [during counseling] on matters of premarital sex, abortion, and the like happen to coincide with the religious views of the AFLA grantee would not be sufficient to show [an Establishment Clause violation].</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080433"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874008624"/></p>

That difference had the effect of giving greater constitutional latitude to public aid to such entities than was afforded direct aid to religious elementary and secondary schools. As noted above, the Court in its recent decisions eliminated the presumption that such religious schools are pervasively sectarian and has extended the same constitutional latitude to aid programs benefiting such schools as it gives to aid programs benefiting religiously affiliated social welfare programs.<marker role="index" misc="idm51873728544"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873023888"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873746608"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874013472"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873725904"/></p>

In its first two encounters, the Court voided one program and upheld another, in which the similarities were at least as significant as the differences. Both cases involved “<quotedText>released time</quotedText>” programs, the establishing of a period during which pupils in public schools were to be allowed, upon parental request, to receive religious instruction. In the first, the religious classes were conducted during regular school hours in the school building by outside teachers furnished by a religious council representing the various faiths, subject to the approval or supervision of the superintendent of schools. Attendance reports were kept and reported to the school authorities in the same way as for other classes, and pupils not attending the religious instruction classes were required to continue their regular studies. “<quotedText>The operation of the State’s compulsory education system thus assists and is integrated with the program of religious instruction carried on by separate religious sects. Pupils compelled by law to go to school for secular education are released in part from their legal duty upon the condition that they attend the religious classes. This is beyond all question a utilization of the tax-established and tax-supported public school system to aid religious groups to spread their faith. And it falls squarely under the ban of the First Amendment . . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080445"/> The case was also noteworthy because of the Court’s express rejection of the contention “<quotedText>that historically the First Amendment was intended to forbid only government preference of one religion over another, not an impartial governmental assistance of all religions.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080449"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872985488"/>Four years later, the Court upheld a different released-time program.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080453"/> In this one, schools released pupils during school hours, on written request of their parents, so that they might leave the school building and go to religious centers for religious instruction or devotional exercises. The churches reported to the schools the names of children released from the public schools who did not report for religious instruction; children not released remained in the classrooms for regular studies. The Court found the differences between this program and the program struck down in <inline role="name" class="case">McCollum</inline> to be constitutionally significant. Unlike <inline role="name" class="case">McCollum</inline>, where “<quotedText>the classrooms were used for religious instruction and force of the public school was used to promote that instruction,</quotedText>”religious instruction was conducted off school premises and “<quotedText>the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080457"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872958704"/>“<quotedText>We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being,</quotedText>”Justice Douglas wrote for the Court. “<quotedText>When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.

The Court wrote: “<quotedText>We think that by using its public school system to encourage recitation of the Regents’ prayer, the State of New York has adopted a practice wholly inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. There can, of course, be no doubt that New York’s program of daily classroom invocation of God’s blessings as prescribed in the Regents’ prayer is a religious activity. . . .

It found the policy to violate each of the tests it has formulated for Establishment Clause cases. The preference given for an “<quotedText>invocation</quotedText>” in the text of the school district’s policy, the long history of pre-game prayer led by a student “<quotedText>chaplain</quotedText>” in the school district, and the widespread perception that “<quotedText>the policy is about prayer,</quotedText>” the Court said, made clear that its purpose was not secular but was to preserve a popular state-sponsored religious practice in violation of the first prong of the <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline> test. Moreover, it said, the policy violated the coercion test by forcing unwilling students into participating in a religious exercise. Some students – the cheerleaders, the band, football players – had to attend, it noted, and others were compelled to do so by peer pressure. “<quotedText>The constitutional command will not permit the District 'to exact religious conformity from a student as the price' of joining her classmates at a varsity football game,</quotedText>” the Court held.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872840992"/> Finally, it said, the speech sanctioned by the policy was not private speech but government-sponsored speech that would be perceived as a government endorsement of religion.

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872795872"/>Although government may not promote religion through its educational facilities, it may not bar student religious groups from meeting on public school property if it makes its facilities available to nonreligious student groups. In <inline role="name" class="case">Widmar v. Vincent</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872793968"/> the Court held that allowing student religious groups equal access to a public college’s facilities would further a secular purpose, would not constitute an impermissible benefit to religion, and would pose little hazard of entanglement. Subsequently, the Court held that these principles apply to public secondary schools as well as to institutions of higher learning. In 1990, in <inline role="name" class="case">Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872789952"/> the Court upheld application of the Equal Access Act<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872786352"/> to prevent a secondary school from denying access to school premises to a student religious club while granting access to such other “<quotedText>noncurriculum</quotedText>”related student groups as a scuba diving club, a chess club, and a service club.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872782512"/> Justice O’Connor stated in a plurality opinion that “<quotedText>there is a crucial difference between <i>government</i> speech endorsing religion and <i>private</i> speech endorsing religion. We think that secondary school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872777648"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872795872"/>Similarly, public schools may not rely on the Establishment Clause as grounds to discriminate against religious groups in after-hours use of school property otherwise available for non-religious social, civic, and recreational purposes. In <inline role="name" class="case">Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches School District</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872771872"/> the Court held that a school district could not, consistent with the free speech clause, refuse to allow a religious group to use school facilities to show a film series on family life when the facilities were otherwise available for community use. “<quotedText>It discriminates on the basis of viewpoint,</quotedText>” the Court ruled, “<quotedText>to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious viewpoint.</quotedText>” In response to the school district’s claim that the Establishment Clause required it to deny use of its facilities to a religious group, the Court said that there was “<quotedText>no realistic danger</quotedText>” in this instance that “<quotedText>the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed</quotedText>” and that such permission would satisfy the requirements of the <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline> test.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872766416"/> Similarly, in <inline role="name" class="case">Good News Club v. Milford Central School</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872758752"/> the Court held the free speech clause to be violated by a school policy that barred a religious children’s club from meeting on school premises after school. Given that other groups teaching morals and character development to young children were allowed to use the school’s facilities, the exclusion, the Court said, “<quotedText>constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.</quotedText>” Moreover, it said, the school had “<quotedText>no valid Establishment Clause interest</quotedText>” because permitting the religious club to meet would not show any favoritism toward religion but would simply “<quotedText>ensure neutrality.</quotedText>”<marker role="index" misc="idm51872795872"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/>Finally, the Court has made clear that public colleges may not exclude student religious organizations from benefits otherwise provided to a full spectrum of student “<quotedText>news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications media groups.</quotedText>” In <inline role="name" class="case">Rosenberger v. Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872750064"/> the Court struck down a university policy that afforded a school subsidy to all student publications except religious ones. Once again, the Court held the denial of the subsidy to constitute viewpoint discrimination in violation of the free speech clause of the First Amendment. In response to the University’s argument that the Establishment Clause required it not to subsidize an enterprise that promotes religion, the Court emphasized that the forum created by the University’s subsidy policy had neither the purpose nor the effect of advancing religion and, because it was open to a variety of viewpoints, was neutral toward religion.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/>These cases make clear that the Establishment Clause does not necessarily trump the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech. In regulating private speech in a public forum, government may not justify discrimination against religious viewpoints as necessary to avoid creating an “<quotedText>establishment</quotedText>” of religion.</p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872743136"/>Every state and the District of Columbia provide for tax exemptions for religious institutions, and the history of such exemptions goes back to the time of our establishment as a polity. The only expression by a Supreme Court Justice prior to 1970 was by Justice Brennan, who deemed tax exemptions constitutional because the benefit conferred was incidental to the religious character of the institutions concerned.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080553"/> Then, in 1970, a nearly unanimous Court sustained a state exemption from real or personal property taxation of “<quotedText>property used exclusively for religious, educational or charitable purposes</quotedText>” owned by a corporation or association which was conducted exclusively for one or more of these purposes and did not operate for profit.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080557"/> The first prong of a two-prong argument saw the Court adopting Justice Brennan’s rationale. Using the secular purpose and effect test, Chief Justice Burger noted that the purpose of the exemption was not to single out churches for special favor; instead, the exemption applied to a broad category of associations having many common features and all dedicated to social betterment. Thus, churches as well as museums, hospitals, libraries, charitable organizations, professional associations, and the like, all non-profit, and all having a beneficial and stabilizing influence in community life, were to be encouraged by being treated specially in the tax laws. The primary effect of the exemptions was not to aid religion; the primary effect was secular and any assistance to religion was merely incidental.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080561"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872743136"/>For the second prong, the Court created a new test, the entanglement test,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080565"/> by which to judge the program. There was some entanglement whether there were exemptions or not, Chief Justice Burger continued, but with exemptions there was minimal involvement. But termination of exemptions would deeply involve government in the internal affairs of religious bodies, because evaluation of religious properties for tax purposes would be required and there would be tax liens and foreclosures and litigation concerning such matters.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080569"/></p>

However, “<quotedText>[i]n light of the evolution of our Sunday Closing Laws through the centuries, and of their more or less recent emphasis upon secular considerations, it is not difficult to discern that as presently written and administered, most of them, at least, are of a secular rather than of a religious character, and that presently they bear no relationship to establishment of religion. . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080613"/>“<quotedText>[T]he fact that this [prescribed day of rest] is Sunday, a day of particular significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals.

United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080637"/> a further constitutional problem arose in which the Court did squarely confront and validate the congressional choice. Congress had restricted conscientious objection status to those who objected to “<quotedText>war in any form</quotedText>” and the Court conceded that there were religious or conscientious objectors who were not opposed to all wars but only to particular wars based upon evaluation of a number of factors by which the “<quotedText>justness</quotedText>” of any particular war could be judged; “<quotedText>properly construed,</quotedText>” the Court said, the statute did draw a line relieving from military service some religious objectors while not relieving others.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080641"/> Purporting to apply the secular purpose and effect test, the Court looked almost exclusively to purpose and hardly at all to effect. Although it is not clear, the Court seemed to require that a classification must be religiously based “<quotedText>on its face</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080645"/> or lack any “<quotedText>neutral, secular basis for the lines government has drawn</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080649"/> in order that it be held to violate the Establishment Clause.

Congress had paid a chaplain and opened sessions with prayers for almost 200 years; the fact that Congress had continued the practice after considering constitutional objections in the Court's view strengthened rather than weakened the historical argument. Similarly, the practice was well rooted in Nebraska and in most other states. Most importantly, the First Amendment had been drafted in the First Congress with an awareness of the chaplaincy practice, and this practice was not prohibited or discontinued.

Basing its holding largely on the nation's long history of using prayer to open legislative sessions as a means to lend gravity to the occasion and to reflect long-held values, the Court concluded that the prayer practice in the Town of Greece fit within this tradition.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872572864"/> The Court also voiced pragmatic concerns with government scrutiny respecting the content of legislative prayers.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872570496"/>As a result, after <inline role="name" class="case">Town of Greece</inline>, absent a “<quotedText>pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose,</quotedText>” First Amendment challenges based solely on the content of a legislative prayer appear unlikely to be successful.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872567088"/> Moreover, absent situations in which a legislative body discriminates against minority faiths, governmental entities that allow for sectarian legislative prayer do not appear to violate the Constitution.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872565856"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872593632"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872592304"/></p>

              <heading>Religious Displays on Government Property</heading>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/>A different form of governmentally sanctioned religious observance – inclusion of religious symbols in governmentally sponsored holiday displays – was twice before the Court, with varying results. In 1984, in <inline role="name" class="case">Lynch v. Donnelly</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080685"/> the Court found that the Establishment Clause was not violated by inclusion of a Nativity scene (creche) in a city’s Christmas display; in 1989, in <inline role="name" class="case">Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080689"/>inclusion of a creche in a holiday display was found to constitute a violation. Also at issue in <inline role="name" class="case">Allegheny County</inline> was inclusion of a menorah in a holiday display; here the Court found no violation. The setting of each display was crucial to the different results in these cases, the determinant being whether the Court majority believed that the overall effect of the display was to emphasize the religious nature of the symbols, or whether instead the emphasis was primarily secular. Perhaps equally important for future cases, however, was the fact that the four dissenters in <inline role="name" class="case">Allegheny County</inline> would have upheld both the creche and menorah displays under a more relaxed, deferential standard.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/>Chief Justice Burger’s opinion for the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Lynch</inline> began by expanding on the religious heritage theme exemplified by <inline role="name" class="case">Marsh</inline>; other evidence that “<quotedText>‘[w]e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080693"/> was supplied by reference to the national motto “<quotedText>In God We Trust,</quotedText>”the affirmation “<quotedText>one nation under God</quotedText>” in the pledge of allegiance, and the recognition of both Thanksgiving and Christmas as national holidays. Against that background, the Court then determined that the city’s inclusion of the creche in its Christmas display had a legitimate secular purpose in recognizing “<quotedText>the historical origins of this traditional event long recognized as a National Holiday,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080697"/> and that its primary effect was not to advance religion. The benefit to religion was called “<quotedText>indirect, remote, and incidental,</quotedText>” and in any event no greater than the benefit resulting from other actions that had been found to be permissible, such as the provision of transportation and textbooks to parochial school students, various assistance to church-supported colleges, Sunday closing laws, and legislative prayers.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080701"/> The Court also reversed the lower court’s finding of entanglement based only on “<quotedText>political divisiveness.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080705"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/><inline role="name" class="case">Allegheny County</inline> was also decided by a 5-4 vote, Justice Blackmun writing the opinion of the Court on the creche issue, and there being no opinion of the Court on the menorah issue.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080709"/> To the majority, the setting of the creche was distinguishable from that in <inline role="name" class="case">Lynch</inline>. The creche stood alone on the center staircase of the county courthouse, bore a sign identifying it as the donation of a Roman Catholic group, and also had an angel holding a banner proclaiming “<quotedText>Gloria in Exclesis Deo.</quotedText>” Nothing in the display “<quotedText>detract[ed] from the creche’s religious message,</quotedText>” and the overall effect was to endorse that religious message.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080713"/> The menorah, on the other hand, was placed outside a government building alongside a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty, and bore no religious messages. To Justice Blackmun, this grouping merely recognized “<quotedText>that both Christmas and Chanukah are part of the same winter-holiday season, which has attained a secular status</quotedText>”;<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080717"/> to concurring Justice O’Connor, the display’s “<quotedText>message of pluralism</quotedText>” did not endorse religion over nonreligion even though Chanukah is primarily a religious holiday and even though the menorah is a religious symbol.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080721"/> The dissenters, critical of the endorsement test proposed by Justice O’Connor and of the three-part <inline role="name" class="case">Lemon</inline> test, would instead distill two principles from the Establishment Clause: “<quotedText>government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in any religion or its exercise; and it may not, in the guise of avoiding hostility or callous indifference, give direct benefits to religion in such a degree that it in fact ‘establishes a state religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080725"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/>In <inline role="name" class="case">Capitol Square Review Bd. v. Pinette</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080729"/>the Court distinguished privately sponsored from governmentally sponsored religious displays on public property. There the Court ruled that Ohio violated free speech rights by refusing to allow the Ku Klux Klan to display an unattended cross in a publicly owned plaza outside the Ohio Statehouse. Because the plaza was a public forum in which the state had allowed a broad range of speakers and a variety of unattended displays, the state could regulate the expressive content of such speeches and displays only if the restriction was necessary, and narrowly drawn, to serve a compelling state interest. The Court recognized that compliance with the Establishment Clause can be a sufficiently compelling reason to justify content-based restrictions on speech, but saw no need to apply this principle when permission to display a religious symbol is granted through the same procedures, and on the same terms, required of other private groups seeking to convey non-religious messages.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/>Displays of the Ten Commandments on government property occasioned two decisions in 2005. As in <inline role="name" class="case">Allegheny County</inline>, a closely divided Court determined that one display violated the Establishment Clause and one did not. And again, context and imputed purpose made the difference. The Court struck down display of the Ten Commandments in courthouses in two Kentucky counties,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872497824"/> but held that a display on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol was permissible.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872494832"/> The displays in the Kentucky courthouses originally “<quotedText>stood alone, not part of an arguably secular display.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872491552"/> Moreover, the history of the displays revealed “<quotedText>a predominantly religious purpose</quotedText>” that had not been eliminated by steps taken to give the appearance of secular objectives.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872485760"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/>There was no opinion of the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Van Orden</inline>. Justice Breyer, the swing vote in the two cases,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872479152"/> distinguished the Texas Capitol grounds display from the Kentucky courthouse displays. In some contexts, the Ten Commandments can convey a moral and historical message as well as a religious one, the Justice explained. Although it was “<quotedText>a borderline case</quotedText>” turning on “<quotedText>a practical matter of <i>degree</i>,</quotedText>” the capitol display served “<quotedText>a primarily nonreligious purpose.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872475872"/> The monument displaying the Ten Commandments was one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers on the Capitol grounds; it was paid for by a private, civic, and primarily secular organization; and it had been in place, unchallenged, for 40 years. Under the circumstances, Justice Breyer thought that few would be likely to understand the monument to represent an attempt by government to favor religion.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872474304"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872559232"/></p>
              <p>The Court has also considered an Establishment Clause challenge to the display of a Latin Cross – erected to honor American soldiers who died in World War I – on federal land located in a remote section of the Mojave Desert.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872465840"/> The legal proceedings leading up to the decision, however, were complicated by congressional attempts to influence the final disposition of the case, including the attempted transfer of the federal land in question to private hands.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872462768"/> As a result, a splintered Court failed to reach the merits of the underlying challenge, and instead remanded the case for further consideration.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872455696"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872451216"/>In <inline role="name" class="case">Larkin v. Grendel’s Den</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080733"/> the Court held that the Establishment Clause is violated by a delegation of governmental decisionmaking to churches. At issue was a state statute permitting any church or school to block issuance of a liquor license to any establishment located within 500 feet of the church or school. Although the statute had a permissible secular purpose of protecting churches and schools from the disruptions often associated with liquor establishments, the Court indicated that these purposes could be accomplished by other means, <i>e.g.</i>, an outright ban on liquor outlets within a prescribed distance, or the vesting of discretionary authority in a governmental decisionmaker required to consider the views of affected parties. However, the conferral of a veto authority on churches had a primary effect of advancing religion both because the delegation was standardless (thereby permitting a church to exercise the power to promote parochial interests), and because “<quotedText>the mere appearance of a joint exercise of legislative authority by Church and State provides a significant symbolic benefit to religion in the minds of some.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080737"/> Moreover, the Court determined, because the veto “<quotedText>enmeshes churches in the exercise of substantial governmental powers,</quotedText>” it represented an entanglement offensive to “<quotedText>the core rationale underlying the Establishment Clause [ – ] preventing ‘a fusion of governmental and religious functions.’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080741"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872451216"/>Using somewhat similar reasoning, the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village v. Grumet</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080745"/> invalidated a New York law creating a special school district for an incorporated village composed exclusively of members of one small religious sect. The statute failed “<quotedText>the test of neutrality,</quotedText>” the Court concluded, since it delegated power “<quotedText>to an electorate defined by common religious belief and practice, in a manner that fails to foreclose religious favoritism.</quotedText>” It was the “<quotedText>anomalously case-specific nature of the legislature’s exercise of authority</quotedText>” that left the Court “<quotedText>without any direct way to review such state action</quotedText>” for conformity with the neutrality principle. Because the village did not receive its governmental authority simply as one of many communities eligible under a general law, the Court explained, there was no way of knowing whether the legislature would grant similar benefits on an equal basis to other religious and nonreligious groups.<marker role="index" misc="idm51874014352"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872451216"/></p>

            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/>“<quotedText>The Free Exercise Clause . . . withdraws from legislative power, state and federal, the exertion of any restraint on the free exercise of religion. Its purpose is to secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions there by civil authority.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080749"/> It bars “<quotedText>governmental regulation of religious <i>beliefs</i> as such,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080753"/> prohibiting misuse of secular governmental programs “<quotedText>to impede the observance of one or all religions or . . . to discriminate invidiously between religions . . . even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080757"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874136080"/> Freedom of conscience is the basis of the Free Exercise Clause, and government may not penalize or discriminate against an individual or a group of individuals because of their religious views nor may it compel persons to affirm any particular beliefs.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080761"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51874136080"/> Interpretation is complicated, however, by the fact that exercise of religion usually entails ritual or other practices that constitute “<quotedText>conduct</quotedText>” rather than pure “<quotedText>belief.</quotedText>”When it comes to protecting conduct as free exercise, the Court has been inconsistent.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080765"/>It has long been held that the Free Exercise Clause does not necessarily prevent the government from requiring the doing of some act or forbidding the doing of some act merely because religious beliefs underlie the conduct in question.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080769"/> What has changed over the years is the Court’s willingness to hold that some religiously motivated conduct is protected from generally applicable prohibitions.</p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/>The relationship between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses varies with the expansiveness of interpretation of the two clauses.<marker role="index" misc="idm51872379312"/> In a general sense both clauses proscribe governmental involvement with and interference in religious matters, but there is possible tension between a requirement of governmental neutrality derived from the Establishment Clause and a Free-Exercise-derived requirement that government accommodate some religious practices.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080773"/> So far, the Court has harmonized interpretation by denying that free-exercise-mandated accommodations create establishment violations, and also by upholding some legislative accommodations not mandated by free exercise requirements. “<quotedText>This Court has long recognized that government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the Establishment Clause.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080777"/>“<quotedText>There is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without [governmental] sponsorship and without interference.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872370160"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872379312"/>In holding that a state could not deny unemployment benefits to Sabbatarians who refused Saturday work, for example, the Court denied that it was “<quotedText>fostering an ‘establishment’ of the Seventh-Day Adventist religion, for the extension of unemployment benefits to Sabbatarians in common with Sunday worshippers reflects nothing more than the governmental obligation of neutrality in the face of religious differences, and does not represent that involvement of religious with secular institutions which it is the object of the Establishment Clause to forestall.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080781"/> Legislation granting religious exemptions not held to have been required by the Free Exercise Clause has been upheld against Establishment Clause challenge,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080785"/> although it is also possible for legislation to go too far in promoting free exercise.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080789"/> Government need not, however, offer the same accommodations to secular entities that it extends to religious practitioners in order to facilitate their religious exercise; “<quotedText>[r]eligious accommodations . . . need not 'come packaged with benefits to secular entities.'</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872326032"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872379312"/>“<quotedText>Play in the joints</quotedText>” can work both ways, the Court ruled in <i>Locke v. Davey</i> upholding a state's exclusion of theology students from a college scholarship program.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872318560"/> Although the state could have included theology students in its scholarship program without offending the Establishment Clause, its choice “<quotedText>not to fund</quotedText>” religious training did not offend the Free Exercise Clause even though that choice singled out theology students for exclusion.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872315104"/> Refusal to fund religious training, the Court observed, was “<quotedText>far milder</quotedText>” than restrictions on religious practices that have been held to offend the Free Exercise Clause.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872312256"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872379312"/></p>
            <p>The Court distinguished <i>Locke</i>, however, in <i>Trinity Lutheran Church</i>, explaining that <i>Locke’s</i> holding hinged on that the fact that the State of Washington was prohibiting the dissemination of scholarship money because of what the theology student “proposed <i>to do</i>” with the money as opposed to “who he <i>was</i>.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872299808"/> In particular, the Court noted that the Washington scholarship program in <i>Locke</i> could be used by students to attend pervasively religious schools, but the program could not be used for the training of the clergy.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872297792"/> In contrast, the <i>Trinity Lutheran Church</i> Court held that the State of Missouri’s decision to exclude an otherwise qualified church from a government grant program on the basis of the church’s <i>religious status</i> violated the Free Exercise Clause.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872295168"/> In so holding, the Court concluded that while the First Amendment allows the government to limit the extent government funds can be put to religious use, the government cannot discriminate based on one’s religious status and, in so doing, put the recipient of a government benefit to the choice between maintaining that status or receiving a government benefit.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872293216"/></p>

The Free Exercise Clause “<quotedText>embraces two concepts – freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute, but in the nature of things, the second cannot be.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080793"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872282320"/> In its first free exercise case, involving the power of government to prohibit polygamy, the Court invoked a hard distinction between the two, saying that although laws “<quotedText>cannot interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they may with practices.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080797"/> The rule thus propounded protected only belief, inasmuch as religiously motivated action was to be subjected to the police power of the state to the same extent as would similar action springing from other motives. The <inline role="name" class="case">Reynolds</inline> no-protection rule was applied in a number of cases,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080801"/> but later cases established that religiously grounded conduct is not always outside the protection of the Free Exercise Clause.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080805"/> Instead, the Court began to balance the secular interest asserted by the government against the claim of religious liberty asserted by the person affected; only if the governmental interest was “<quotedText>compelling</quotedText>” and if no alternative forms of regulation would serve that interest was the claimant required to yield.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080809"/> Thus, although freedom to engage in religious practices was not absolute, it was entitled to considerable protection.<marker role="index" misc="idm51872282320"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51872290272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872288512"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/>Later cases evidence a narrowing of application of the compelling interest test, and a corresponding constriction of the freedom to engage in religiously motivated conduct. First, the Court purported to apply strict scrutiny, but upheld the governmental action anyhow.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872236144"/> Next, the Court held that the test is inappropriate in the contexts of military and prison discipline.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080813"/> Then, more importantly, the Court ruled in <inline role="name" class="case">Employment Division v. Smith</inline> that “<quotedText>if prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is not the object . . . but merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080817"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872218752"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872217280"/>Therefore, the Court concluded, the Free Exercise Clause does not prohibit a state from applying generally applicable criminal penalties to the use of peyote in a religious ceremony, or from denying unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs because of religious ceremonial use of peyote. Accommodation of such religious practices must be found in “<quotedText>the political process,</quotedText>” the Court noted; statutory religious-practice exceptions are permissible, but not “<quotedText>constitutionally required.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080821"/> The result is tantamount to a return to the <inline role="name" class="case">Reynolds</inline> belief-conduct distinction.<marker role="index" misc="idm51872290272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872288512"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872218752"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872217280"/><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51872207568"/></p>

The Court sustained the law, even as applied to persons entering the state prior to enactment of the original law prohibiting bigamy and to persons as to whom the statute of limitations had run.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080829"/> Subsequently, an act of a territorial legislature that required a prospective voter not only to swear that he was not a bigamist or polygamist but also that “<quotedText>I am not a member of any order, organization or association which teaches, advises, counsels or encourages its members, devotees or any other person to commit the crime of bigamy or polygamy . . . or which practices bigamy, polygamy or plural or celestial marriage as a doctrinal rite of such organization; that I do not and will not, publicly or privately, or in any manner whatever teach, advise, counsel or encourage any person to commit the crime of bigamy or polygamy . . . ,</quotedText>” was upheld in an opinion that condemned plural marriage and its advocacy as equal evils.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080833"/> And, finally, the Court sustained the revocation of the charter of the Mormon Church and confiscation of all church property not actually used for religious worship or for burial.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080837"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872203648"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872282320"/></p>

Sherbert was disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation because, as a Seventh Day Adventist, she would not accept Saturday work; according to state officials, this meant she was not complying with the statutory requirement to stand ready to accept suitable employment. If this denial of benefits is to be upheld, the Court said, “<quotedText>it must be either because her disqualification as a beneficiary represents no infringement by the State of her constitutional rights of free exercise, or because any incidental burden on the free exercise of appellant’s religions may be justified by a ‘compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject within the State’s constitutional power to regulate . . . .’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080900"/> First, the disqualification was held to impose a burden on the free exercise of Sherbert’s religion; it was an indirect burden and it did not impose a criminal sanction on a religious practice, but the disqualification derived solely from her practice of her religion and constituted a compulsion upon her to forgo that practice.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080903"/> Second, there was no compelling interest demonstrated by the state. The only interest asserted was the prevention of the possibility of fraudulent claims, but that was merely a bare assertion.

Review Board</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080909"/> involved a Jehovah’s Witness who quit his job when his employer transferred him from a department making items for industrial use to a department making parts for military equipment. While his belief that his religion proscribed work on war materials was not shared by all other Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Court held that it was inappropriate to inquire into the validity of beliefs asserted to be religious so long as the claims were made in good faith (and the beliefs were at least arguably religious). The same result was reached in a 1987 case, the fact that the employee’s religious conversion rather than a job reassignment had created the conflict between work and Sabbath observance not being considered material to the determination that free exercise rights had been burdened by the denial of unemployment compensation.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080912"/> Also, a state may not deny unemployment benefits solely because refusal to work on the Sabbath was based on sincere religious beliefs held independently of membership in any established religious church or sect.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080915"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872015760"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>The Court applied the <inline role="name" class="case">Sherbert</inline> balancing test in several areas outside of unemployment compensation. The first two such cases involved the Amish, whose religion requires them to lead a simple life of labor and worship in a tight-knit and self-reliant community largely insulated from the materialism and other distractions of modern life. <marker role="index" misc="idm51871974352"/><inline role="name" class="case">Wisconsin v. Yoder</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080918"/> held that a state compulsory attendance law, as applied to require Amish children to attend ninth and tenth grades of public schools in contravention of Amish religious beliefs, violated the Free Exercise Clause. The Court first determined that the beliefs of the Amish were indeed religiously based and of great antiquity.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080920"/> Next, the Court rejected the state’s arguments that the Free Exercise Clause extends no protection because the case involved “<quotedText>action</quotedText>” or “<quotedText>conduct</quotedText>” rather than belief, and because the regulation, neutral on its face, did not single out religion.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080922"/> Instead, the Court analyzed whether a “<quotedText>compelling</quotedText>” governmental interest required such “<quotedText>grave interference</quotedText>” with Amish belief and practices.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080924"/> The governmental interest was not the general provision of education, as the state and the Amish agreed as to education through the first eight grades and as the Amish provided their children with additional education of a primarily vocational nature. The state’s interest was really that of providing two additional years of public schooling. Nothing in the record, the Court found, showed that this interest outweighed the great harm that it would do to traditional Amish religious beliefs to impose the compulsory ninth and tenth grade attendance.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080926"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871974352"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>But a subsequent decision involving the Amish reached a contrary conclusion.<marker role="index" misc="idm51871955280"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">United States v. Lee</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080927"/> the Court denied the Amish exemption from compulsory participation in the Social Security system. The objection was that payment of taxes by Amish employers and employees and the receipt of public financial assistance were forbidden by their religious beliefs. Accepting that this was true, the Court nonetheless held that the governmental interest was compelling and therefore sufficient to justify the burdening of religious beliefs.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080928"/>Compulsory payment of taxes was necessary for the vitality of the system; either voluntary participation or a pattern of exceptions would undermine its soundness and make the program difficult to administer.<marker role="index" misc="idm51871955280"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>“<quotedText>A compelling governmental interest</quotedText>” was also found to outweigh free exercise interests in <inline role="name" class="case">Bob Jones University v. United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080929"/> in which the Court upheld the I.R.S.’s denial of tax exemptions to church-run colleges whose racially discriminatory admissions policies derived from religious beliefs. The Federal Government’s “<quotedText>fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education</quotedText>” – found to be encompassed in common law standards of “<quotedText>charity</quotedText>” underlying conferral of the tax exemption on “<quotedText>charitable</quotedText>” institutions – “<quotedText>substantially outweighs</quotedText>” the burden on free exercise. Nor could the schools’ free exercise interests be accommodated by less restrictive means.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080930"/></p>

As long as a particular religion does not proscribe the payment of taxes (as was the case with the Amish in <inline role="name" class="case">Lee</inline>), the Court has denied that there is any constitutionally significant burden resulting from “<quotedText>imposition of a generally applicable tax [that] merely decreases the amount of money [adherents] have to spend on [their] religious activities.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080933"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871930592"/> The one caveat the Court left – that a generally applicable tax might be so onerous as to “<quotedText>effectively choke off an adherent’s religious practices</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080934"/> – may be a moot point in light of the Court’s general ruling in <inline role="name" class="case">Employment Division v.

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>The Court also drew a distinction between governmental regulation of individual conduct, on the one hand, and restraint of governmental conduct as a result of individuals’ religious beliefs, on the other. <inline role="name" class="case">Sherbert</inline><i>’s</i> compelling interest test has been held inapplicable in cases viewed as involving attempts by individuals to alter governmental actions rather than attempts by government to restrict religious practices. Emphasizing the absence of coercion on religious adherents, the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080935"/> held that the Forest Service, even absent a compelling justification, could construct a road through a portion of a national forest held sacred and used by Indians in religious observances. The Court distinguished between governmental actions having the indirect effect of frustrating religious practices and those actually prohibiting religious belief or conduct: “<quotedText>‘the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080936"/> Similarly, even a sincerely held religious belief that assignment of a social security number would rob a child of her soul was held insufficient to bar the government from using the number for purposes of its own recordkeeping.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080937"/> It mattered not how easily the government could accommodate the religious beliefs or practices (an exemption from the social security number requirement might have been granted with only slight impact on the government’s recordkeeping capabilities), since the nature of the governmental actions did not implicate free exercise protections.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080938"/></p>

The general rule is that prison regulations impinging on exercise of constitutional rights by inmates are “<quotedText>‘valid if . . . reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080941"/> Thus because general prison rules requiring a particular category of inmates to work outside of buildings where religious services were held, and prohibiting return to the buildings during the work day, could be viewed as reasonably related to legitimate penological concerns of security and order, no exemption was required to permit Muslim inmates to participate in Jumu’ah, the core ceremony of their religion.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080942"/>The fact that the inmates were left with no alternative means of attending Jumu’ah was not dispositive, the Court being “<quotedText>unwilling to hold that prison officials are required by the Constitution to sacrifice legitimate penological objectives to that end.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080943"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871855104"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871851552"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>Finally, in <inline role="name" class="case">Employment Division v. Smith</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080944"/>the Court indicated that the compelling interest test may apply only in the field of unemployment compensation, and in any event does not apply to require exemptions from generally applicable criminal laws. Criminal laws are “<quotedText>generally applicable</quotedText>” when they apply across the board regardless of the religious motivation of the prohibited conduct, and are “<quotedText>not specifically directed at . . . religious practices.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080945"/> The unemployment compensation statute at issue in <inline role="name" class="case">Sherbert</inline> was peculiarly suited to application of a balancing test because denial of benefits required a finding that an applicant had refused work “<quotedText>without good cause.</quotedText>”<inline role="name" class="case">Sherbert</inline> and other unemployment compensation cases thus “<quotedText>stand for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080946"/><inline role="name" class="case">Wisconsin v. Yoder</inline> and other decisions holding “<quotedText>that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action</quotedText>” were distinguished as involving “<quotedText>not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections</quotedText>” such as free speech or “<quotedText>parental rights.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080947"/> Except in the relatively uncommon circumstance when a statute calls for individualized consideration, the Free Exercise Clause affords no basis for exemption from a “<quotedText>neutral, generally applicable law.</quotedText>” As the Court concluded in <inline role="name" class="case">Smith</inline>, accommodation for religious practices incompatible with general requirements must ordinarily be found in “<quotedText>the political process.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080948"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><inline role="name" class="case">Smith</inline> has potentially widespread ramifications. <marker role="index" misc="idm51872288512"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>The Court has apparently returned to a belief-conduct dichotomy under which religiously motivated conduct is not entitled to special protection. Laws may not single out religiously motivated conduct for adverse treatment,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080952"/> but formally neutral laws of general applicability may regulate religious conduct (along with other conduct) regardless of the adverse or prohibitory effects on religious exercise. That the Court views the principle as a general one, not limited to criminal laws, seems evident from its restatement in <inline role="name" class="case">Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah</inline>: “<quotedText>our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general application need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080953"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51872288512"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51873840736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872094832"/>Similar rules govern taxation. Under the Court’s rulings in <inline role="name" class="case">Smith</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Swaggart</inline>, religious exemptions from most taxes are a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional command, since most important taxes (<i>e.g.</i>, income, property, sales and use) satisfy the criteria of formal neutrality and general applicability, and are not license fees that can be viewed as prior restraints on expression.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080954"/> The result is equal protection, but not substantive protection, for religious exercise.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080955"/> The Court’s approach also accords less protection to religiously based conduct than is accorded expressive conduct that implicates speech but not religious values.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080956"/> On the practical side, relegation of free exercise claims to the political process may, as concurring Justice O’Connor warned, result in less protection for small, unpopular religious sects.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080957"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872288512"/></p>
              <p>It does appear that, despite <inline role="name" class="case">Smith</inline>, the Court is still inclined to void the application of generally applicable laws to religious conduct when the prohibited activity is engaged in, not by an individual adherant, but by a religious institution. For instance, in <inline role="name" class="case">Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871776768"/> the Court established a “<quotedText>ministerial exception</quotedText>” that precludes the application of employment discrimination laws<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871775072"/> to claims arising out of an employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871773088"/> The Court found that even where such law is a “<quotedText>valid and neutral law of general applicability,</quotedText>” and even if the basis for the employment decision is not religious doctrine, the Free Exercise Clause prohibits the application of an employment discrimination law, since enforcement of such law would involve “<quotedText>government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871768704"/></p>

In the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA),<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080949"/> Congress sought to supersede <inline role="name" class="case">Smith</inline> and substitute a statutory rule of decision for free exercise cases. The Act provides that laws of general applicability – federal, state, and local – may substantially burden free exercise of religion only if they further a compelling governmental interest and constitute the least restrictive means of doing so. The purpose, Congress declared in the Act itself, was “<quotedText>to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in <inline role="name" class="case">Sherbert v. Verner</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Wisconsin v. Yoder</inline> and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080950"/> But this legislative effort was partially frustrated in 1997 when the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">City of Boerne v. Flores</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871753344"/>held the Act unconstitutional as applied to the states. In applying RFRA to the states, Congress had exercised its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact “<quotedText>appropriate legislation</quotedText>” to enforce the substantive protections of the Amendment, including the religious liberty protections incorporated in the Due Process Clause. But the Court held that RFRA exceeded Congress’s power under § 5, because the measure did not simply enforce a constitutional right but substantively altered that right. “<quotedText>Congress,</quotedText>” the Court said, “<quotedText>does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871749808"/> Moreover, it said, RFRA “<quotedText>reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved . . .

              <p>Congress responded to <inline role="name" class="case">Boerne</inline> by enacting a new law purporting to rest on its commerce and spending powers.

          <note role="topic">
            <heading>Adoption and the Common Law Background</heading>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871651472"/>Madison’s version of the speech and press clauses, introduced in the House of Representatives on June 8, 1789, provided: “<quotedText>The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080960"/> The special committee rewrote the language to some extent, adding other provisions from Madison’s draft, to make it read: “<quotedText>The freedom of speech and of the press, and the right of the people peaceably to assemble and consult for their common good, and to apply to the government for redress of grievances, shall not be infringed.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080961"/> In this form it went to the Senate, which rewrote it to read: “<quotedText>That Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and consult for their common good, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080962"/>Subsequently, the religion clauses and these clauses were combined by the Senate.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080963"/> The final language was agreed upon in conference.</p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871651472"/>Debate in the House is unenlightening with regard to the meaning the Members ascribed to the speech and press clause, and there is no record of debate in the Senate.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080964"/> In the course of debate, Madison warned against the dangers that would arise “<quotedText>from discussing and proposing abstract propositions, of which the judgment may not be convinced. I venture to say, that if we confine ourselves to an enumeration of simple, acknowledged principles, the ratification will meet with but little difficulty.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080965"/>That the “<quotedText>simple, acknowledged principles</quotedText>” embodied in the First Amendment have occasioned controversy without end both in the courts and out should alert one to the difficulties latent in such spare language.</p>
            <p> Insofar as there is likely to have been a consensus, it was no doubt the common law view as expressed by Blackstone. “<quotedText>The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying no <i>previous</i> restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press: but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous, or illegal, he must take the consequences of his own temerity. To subject the press to the restrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the Revolution, is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion and government. But to punish as the law does at present any dangerous or offensive writings, which, when published, shall on a fair and impartial trial be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty. Thus, the will of individuals is still left free: the abuse only of that free will is the object of legal punishment. Neither is any restraint hereby laid upon freedom of thought or inquiry; liberty of private sentiment is still left; the disseminating, or making public, of bad sentiments, destructive to the ends of society, is the crime which society corrects.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080966"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871625216"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871624384"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871651472"/>Whatever the general unanimity on this proposition at the time of the proposal of and ratification of the First Amendment,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080967"/>it appears that there emerged in the course of the Jeffersonian counterattack on the Sedition Act<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080968"/> and the use by the Adams Administration of the Act to prosecute its political opponents,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080969"/> something of a libertarian theory of freedom of speech and press,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080970"/> which, however much the Jeffersonians may have departed from it upon assuming power,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080971"/> was to blossom into the theory undergirding Supreme Court First Amendment jurisprudence in modern times. <marker role="index" misc="idm51871625216"/>Full acceptance of the theory that the Amendment operates not only to bar most prior restraints of expression but subsequent punishment of all but a narrow range of expression, in political discourse and indeed in all fields of expression, dates from a quite recent period, although the Court’s movement toward that position began in its consideration of limitations on speech and press in the period following World War I.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080972"/>Thus, in 1907, Justice Holmes could observe that, even if the Fourteenth Amendment embodied prohibitions similar to the First Amendment, “<quotedText>still we should be far from the conclusion that the plaintiff in error would have us reach. In the first place, the main purpose of such constitutional provisions is 'to prevent all such <i>previous restraints</i> upon publications as had been practiced by other governments,' and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare. The preliminary freedom extends as well to the false as to the true; the subsequent punishment may extend as well to the true as to the false. This was the law of criminal libel apart from statute in most cases, if not in all.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080973"/> But as Justice Holmes also observed, “<quotedText>[t]here is no constitutional right to have all general propositions of law once adopted remain unchanged.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080974"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871568560"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871624384"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871651472"/>But, in <inline role="name" class="case">Schenck v. United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080975"/> the first of the post-World War I cases to reach the Court, Justice Holmes, in his opinion for the Court upholding convictions for violating the Espionage Act by attempting to cause insubordination in the military service by circulation of leaflets, suggested First Amendment restraints on subsequent punishment as well as on prior restraint. “<quotedText>It well may be that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to previous restraints, although to prevent them may have been the main purpose . . . . We admit that in many places and in ordinary times the defendants in saying all that was said in the circular would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. . . . The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. . . . The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.</quotedText>”</p>
            <p> Justice Holmes, along with Justice Brandeis, soon went into dissent in their views that the majority of the Court was misapplying the legal standards thus expressed to uphold suppression of speech that offered no threat to organized institutions.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080976"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871648656"/> But it was with the Court’s assumption that the Fourteenth Amendment restrained the power of the states to suppress speech and press that the doctrines developed.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080977"/> At first, Holmes and Brandeis remained in dissent, but, in <inline role="name" class="case">Fiske v. Kansas</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080978"/> the Court sustained a First Amendment type of claim in a state case, and in <inline role="name" class="case">Stromberg v. California</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080979"/> voided a state statute on grounds of its interference with free speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080980"/> State common law was also voided, with the Court in an opinion by Justice Black asserting that the First Amendment enlarged protections for speech, press, and religion beyond those enjoyed under English common law.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080981"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871624384"/></p>

            <heading>Freedom of Expression: The Philosophical Basis</heading>
            <p>Probably no other provision of the Constitution has given rise to so many different views with respect to its underlying philosophical foundations, and hence proper interpretive framework, as has the guanantee of freedom of expression.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080989"/> The argument has been fought out among the commentators. “<quotedText>The outstanding fact about the First Amendment today is that the Supreme Court has never developed any comprehensive theory of what that constitutional guarantee means and how it should be applied in concrete cases.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080990"/> Some commentators argue on behalf of a complex of values, none of which by itself is sufficient to support a broad-based protection of freedom of expression.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080991"/> Others would limit the basis of the First Amendment to only one among a constellation of possible values and would therefore limit the coverage or the degree of protection of the speech and press clauses.</p>
            <p> For example, one school of thought believes that, because of the constitutional commitment to free self-government, only political speech is within the core protected area,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080992"/> although some commentators tend to define more broadly the concept of “<quotedText>political</quotedText>” than one might suppose from the word alone. Others recur to the writings of Milton and Mill and argue that protecting speech, even speech in error, is necessary for the eventual ascertainment of the truth through the conflict of ideas in the marketplace – a view skeptical of our ability ever to know the truth.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080993"/> A broader-grounded view is expounded by scholars who argue that freedom of expression is necessary to promote individual self-fulfillment – that, when speech is freely chosen by the speaker to persuade others, it defines and expresses the speaker's “<quotedText>self</quotedText>” and promotes his liberty<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080994"/> and “<quotedText>self-realization</quotedText>” by enabling him to develop his powers and abilities and to make and influence decisions regarding his destiny.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080995"/> The literature is enormous and no doubt the Justices as well as the larger society are influenced by it, and yet the decisions, probably in large part because they are the collective determination of nine individuals, seldom clearly reflect a principled and consistent acceptance of any philosophy.</p>

            <heading>Freedom of Expression: Is There a Difference Between Speech and Press?</heading>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871399104"/>Use of the single word “<quotedText>expression</quotedText>” to reach speech, press, petition, association, and the like, raises the question of whether the free speech clause and the free press clause are coextensive, or whether one reaches where the other does not. It has been much debated, for example, whether the “<quotedText>institutional press</quotedText>” is entitled to greater freedom from governmental regulations or restrictions than are non-press individuals, groups, or associations. Justice Stewart has argued: “<quotedText>That the First Amendment speaks separately of freedom of speech and freedom of the press is no constitutional accident, but an acknowledgment of the critical role played by the press in American society. The Constitution requires sensitivity to that role, and to the special needs of the press in performing it effectively.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080996"/> But, as Chief Justice Burger wrote: “<quotedText>The Court has not yet squarely resolved whether the Press Clause confers upon the ‘institutional press’ any freedom from government restraint not enjoyed by all others.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080997"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871399104"/>Several Court holdings do firmly point to the conclusion that the press clause does not confer on the press the power to compel government to furnish information or otherwise give the press access to information that the public generally does not have.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080998"/> Nor, in many respects, is the press entitled to treatment different in kind from the treatment to which any other member of the public may be subjected.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080999"/>“<quotedText>Generally applicable laws do not offend the First Amendment simply because their enforcement against the press has incidental effects.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081000"/> Yet, it does seem clear that, to some extent, the press, because of its role in disseminating news and information, is entitled to deference that others are not entitled to – that its role constitutionally entitles it to governmental “<quotedText>sensitivity,</quotedText>” to use Justice Stewart’s word.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081001"/> What difference such “<quotedText>sensitivity</quotedText>” might make in deciding cases is difficult to say.</p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871333088"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871399104"/>The most interesting possibility lies in the First Amendment protection of good-faith defamation.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081002"/> Justice Stewart argued that the <inline role="name" class="case">Sullivan</inline> privilege is exclusively a free press right, denying that the “<quotedText>constitutional theory of free speech gives an individual any immunity from liability for libel or slander.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081003"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871322160"/> To be sure, in all the cases to date that the Supreme Court has resolved, the defendant has been, in some manner, of the press,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081004"/> but the Court’s decision in <inline role="name" class="case">First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti</inline> that corporations are entitled to assert First Amendment speech guarantees against federal and, through the Fourteenth Amendment, state, regulations causes the evaporation of the supposed “<quotedText>conflict</quotedText>” between speech clause protection of individuals only and press clause protection of press corporations as well as of press individuals.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081005"/> The issue, the Court wrote in <inline role="name" class="case">Bellotti</inline>, was not what constitutional rights corporations have but whether the speech that is being restricted is protected by the First Amendment because of its societal significance. Because the speech in <inline role="name" class="case">Bellotti</inline> concerned the enunciation of views on the conduct of governmental affairs, it was protected regardless of its source; while the First Amendment protects and fosters individual self-expression as a worthy goal, it also and as importantly affords the public access to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas. Despite <inline role="name" class="case">Bellotti</inline><i>’s</i> emphasis upon the political nature of the contested speech, it is clear that the same principle – the right of the public to receive information – governs nonpolitical, corporate speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081006"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871322160"/></p>

Minnesota ex rel. Olson</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081011"/>in which a five-to-four majority voided a law authorizing the permanent enjoining of future violations by any newspaper or periodical once found to have published or circulated an “<quotedText>obscene, lewd and lascivious</quotedText>” or a “<quotedText>malicious, scandalous and defamatory</quotedText>” issue. An injunction had been issued after the newspaper in question had printed a series of articles tying local officials to gangsters. Although the dissenters maintained that the injunction constituted no prior restraint, because that doctrine applied to prohibitions of publication without advance approval of an executive official,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081012"/> the majority deemed it “<quotedText>the essence of censorship</quotedText>” that, in order to avoid a contempt citation, the newspaper would have to clear future publications in advance with the judge.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081013"/> Liberty of the press to scrutinize closely the conduct of public affairs was essential, said Chief Justice Hughes for the Court. “<quotedText>[T]he administration of government has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and corruption have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by unfaithful officials and of the impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and official neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press, especially in great cities. The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with official misconduct. Subsequent punishment for such abuses as may exist is the appropriate remedy, consistent with constitutional privilege.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081014"/> The Court did not explore the kinds of restrictions to which the term “<quotedText>prior restraint</quotedText>” would apply, nor do more than assert that only in “<quotedText>exceptional cases</quotedText>” would prior restraint be permissible.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081015"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871284640"/></p>
            <p>Nor did subsequent cases substantially illuminate the murky interior of the doctrine. The doctrine of prior restraint was called upon by the Court as it struck down restrictions on First Amendment rights, including a series of loosely drawn statutes and ordinances requiring licenses to hold meetings and parades and to distribute literature, with uncontrolled discretion in the licensor whether or not to issue them.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081016"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871224688"/>The doctrine that generally emerged was that permit systems and prior licensing are constitutionally valid so long as the discretion of the issuing official was limited to questions of time, place, and manner.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081017"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871199056"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871197120"/>“<quotedText>[<i>O</i>]<i>nly</i> content-based injunctions are subject to prior restraint analysis.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871194416"/></p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has written that “<quotedText>[t]he special vice of a prior restraint is that communication will be suppressed . . . before an adequate determination that it is unprotected by the First Amendment.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871163984"/> The prohibition on prior restraint, thus, is essentially a limitation on restraints until a final judicial determination that the restricted speech is not protected by the First Amendment. It is a limitation, for example, against temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions pending final judgment, not against permanent injunctions after a final judgment is made that the restricted speech is not protected by the First Amendment.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871158032"/></p>
            <p>The Supreme Court has also written “<quotedText>that traditional prior restraint doctrine may not apply to [commercial speech],</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871155184"/> and “<quotedText>[t]he vast majority of [federal] circuits . . . do not apply the doctrine of prior restraint to commercial speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871149936"/>“<quotedText>Some circuits [however] have explicitly indicated that the requirement of procedural safeguards in the context of a prior restraint indeed applies to commercial speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871146544"/> In addition, prior restraint is generally permitted, even in the form of preliminary injunctions, in intellectual property cases, such as those for infringements of copyright or trademark.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51871138208"/></p>

The Court used the Learned Hand formulation of the “<quotedText>clear and present danger</quotedText>” test<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081021"/> and considered as factors in any decision on the imposition of a restraint upon press reporters “<quotedText>(a) the nature and extent of pretrial news coverage; (b) whether other measures would be likely to mitigate the effects of unrestrained pretrial publicity; and (c) how effectively a restraining order would operate to prevent the threatened danger.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081022"/> Though the Court found that one seeking a restraining order must meet “<quotedText>the heavy burden of demonstrating, in advance of trial, that without a prior restraint a fair trial would be denied,</quotedText>” it refused to “<quotedText>rule out the possibility of showing the kind of threat to fair trial rights that would possess the requisite degree of certainty to justify restraint.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081023"/> Justice Brennan’s concurring opinion flatly took the position that such restraining orders were never permissible. Commentary and reporting on the criminal justice system is at the core of First Amendment values, he would have held, and secrecy can do so much harm “<quotedText>that there can be no prohibition on the publication by the press of any information pertaining to pending judicial proceedings or the operation of the criminal justice system, no matter how shabby the means by which the information is obtained.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081024"/> The only circumstance in which prior restraint of protected speech might be permissible is when publication would cause “<quotedText>virtually certain, direct, and immediate</quotedText>” national harm, Justice Brennan continued, but “<quotedText>the harm to a fair trial that might otherwise eventuate from publications which are suppressed . . . must inherently remain speculative.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081025"/> Although the result in the case does not foreclose the possibility of future “<quotedText>gag orders,</quotedText>” it does lessen the number to be expected and shifts the focus to other alternatives for protecting trial rights.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081026"/> On a different level, however, are orders that restrain the press as a party to litigation in the dissemination of information obtained through pretrial discovery.

If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care whole-heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your power or your premises. But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas – that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.

They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law – the argument of force in its worst form.

Leaving aside for the moment the problem of “<quotedText>speech-plus</quotedText>” communication, it becomes necessary to determine when expression that may be a nexus to criminal conduct is subject to punishment and restraint. At first, the Court seemed disposed in the few cases reaching it to rule that if the conduct could be made criminal, the advocacy of or promotion of the conduct could be made criminal.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081041"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870935728"/>Then, in <inline role="name" class="case">Schenck v. United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081042"/> in which the defendants had been convicted of seeking to disrupt recruitment of military personnel by disseminating leaflets, Justice Holmes formulated the “<quotedText>clear and present danger</quotedText>” test that has ever since been the starting point of argument.“<quotedText>The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081043"/> The convictions were unanimously affirmed. One week later, the Court again unanimously affirmed convictions under the same act with Justice Holmes writing, “<quotedText>we think it necessary to add to what has been said in <inline role="name" class="case">Schenck v. United States</inline> only that the First Amendment while prohibiting legislation against free speech as such cannot have been, and obviously was not, intended to give immunity for every possible use of language. We venture to believe that neither Hamilton nor Madison, nor any other competent person then or later, ever supposed that to make criminal the counselling of a murder within the jurisdiction of Congress would be an unconstitutional interference with free speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081044"/> And, in <inline role="name" class="case">Debs v.

United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081046"/> however, Justices Holmes and Brandeis dissented upon affirmance of the convictions of several alien anarchists who had printed leaflets seeking to encourage discontent with the United States' participation in World War I. The majority simply referred to <inline role="name" class="case">Schenck</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Frohwerk</inline> to rebut the First Amendment argument, but the dissenters urged that the government had made no showing of a clear and present danger. Another affirmance by the Court of a conviction, the majority simply saying that “<quotedText>[t]he tendency of the articles and their efficacy were enough for the offense,</quotedText>” drew a similar dissent.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081047"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870901728"/> Moreover, in <inline role="name" class="case">Gitlow v. New York</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51870899680"/> a conviction for distributing a manifesto in violation of a law making it criminal to advocate, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety of overthrowing organized government by force or violence, the Court affirmed in the absence of any evidence regarding the effect of the distribution and in the absence of any contention that it created any immediate threat to the security of the state<marker role="index" misc="idm51870901728"/>. In so doing, the Court discarded Holmes’ test. “<quotedText>It is clear that the question in such cases [as this] is entirely different from that involved in those cases where the statute merely prohibits certain acts involving the danger of substantive evil, without any reference to language itself, and it is sought to apply its provisions to language used by the defendant for the purpose of bringing about the prohibited results. . . . In such cases it has been held that the general provisions of the statute may be constitutionally applied to the specific utterance of the defendant if its natural tendency and probable effect was to bring about the substantive evil which the legislative body might prevent. . . . And the general statement in the <i>Schenck Case</i> . . . was manifestly intended . . . to apply only in cases of this class, and has no application to those like the present, where the legislative body itself has previously determined the danger of substantive evil arising from utterances of a specified character.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081049"/> Thus, a state legislative determination “<quotedText>that utterances advocating the overthrow of organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, are so inimical to the general welfare and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be penalized in the exercise of its police power</quotedText>” was almost conclusive to the Court.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081050"/> It is not clear what test, if any, the majority would have used, although the “<quotedText>bad tendency</quotedText>” test has usually been associated with the case. In <inline role="name" class="case">Whitney v. California</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081051"/> the Court affirmed a conviction under a criminal syndicalism statute based on the defendant’s association with and membership in an organization that advocated the commission of illegal acts, finding again that the determination of a legislature that such advocacy involves “<quotedText>danger to the public peace and the security of the State</quotedText>” was entitled to almost conclusive weight. In a technical concurrence, which was in fact a dissent from the opinion of the Court, Justice Brandeis restated the “<quotedText>clear and present danger</quotedText>” test. “<quotedText>[E]ven advocacy of violation [of the law] . . . is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy fails short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on. . . . In order to support a finding of clear and present danger it must be shown either that immediate serious violence was to be expected or was advocated, or that the past conduct furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081052"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871197120"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870935728"/></p>

It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of speech, though not absolute, . . . is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081060"/> The dissenters focused on the disorders that had actually occurred as a result of Terminiello’s speech, Justice Jackson saying: “<quotedText>Rioting is a substantive evil, which I take it no one will deny that the State and the City have the right and the duty to prevent and punish . . . .

California</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081065"/> however, in which contempt citations had been brought against a newspaper and a labor leader for statements made about pending judicial proceedings, Justice Black, for a five-to-four majority, began by applying the clear and present danger test, which he interpreted to require that “<quotedText>the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances can be punished.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081066"/> He noted that “<quotedText>[t]he substantive evil here sought to be averted . . . appears to be double: disrespect for the judiciary; and disorderly and unfair administration of justice.</quotedText>” As for the first evil, Justice Black rejected “<quotedText>[t]he assumption that respect for the judiciary can be won by shielding judges from published criticism . . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081067"/> As for “<quotedText>[t]he other evil feared, disorderly and unfair administration of justice, [it] is more plausibly associated with restricting publications which touch upon pending litigation.</quotedText>” But the “<quotedText>degree of likelihood</quotedText>” of the evil being accomplished was not “<quotedText>sufficient to justify summary punishment.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081068"/> In dissent, Justice Frankfurter accepted the application of the clear and present danger, but he interpreted it as meaning no more than a “<quotedText>reasonable tendency</quotedText>” test. “<quotedText>Comment however forthright is one thing. Intimidation with respect to specific matters still in judicial suspense, quite another. . . . A publication intended to teach the judge a lesson, or to vent spleen, or to discredit him, or to influence him in his future conduct, would not justify exercise of the contempt power. . . . It must refer to a matter under consideration and constitute in effect a threat to its impartial disposition. It must be calculated to create an atmospheric pressure incompatible with rational, impartial adjudication. But to interfere with justice it need not succeed. As with other offenses, the state should be able to proscribe attempts that fail because of the danger that attempts may succeed.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081069"/></p>

Specifically alluding to clear and present danger, while seeming to regard it as stringent a test as Justice Black had in the prior case, Justice Reed wrote that the danger sought to be averted, a “<quotedText>threat to the impartial and orderly administration of justice,</quotedText>”“<quotedText>has not the clearness and immediacy necessary to close the door of permissible public comment.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081070"/> Divided again, the Court a year later set aside contempt convictions based on publication, while a motion for a new trial was pending, of inaccurate and unfair accounts and an editorial concerning the trial of a civil case. “<quotedText>The vehemence of the language used is not alone the measure of the power to punish for contempt. The fires which it kindles must constitute an imminent, and not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately imperil.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081071"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871284640"/></p>

Georgia</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081072"/> the Court again divided, applying clear and present danger to upset the contempt conviction of a sheriff who had been cited for criticizing the recommendation of a county court that a grand jury look into African-American bloc voting, vote buying, and other alleged election irregularities. No showing had been made, said Chief Justice Warren, of “<quotedText>a substantive evil actually designed to impede the course of justice.</quotedText>” The case presented no situation in which someone was on trial, there was no judicial proceeding pending that might be prejudiced, and the dispute was more political than judicial.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081073"/> A unanimous Court in 1972 apparently applied the standard to set aside a contempt conviction of a defendant who, arguing his own case, alleged before the jury that the trial judge by his bias had prejudiced his trial and that he was a political prisoner. Though the defendant’s remarks may have been disrespectful of the court, the Supreme Court noted that “<quotedText>[t]here is no indication . . . that petitioner’s statements were uttered in a boisterous tone or in any wise actually disrupted the court proceeding</quotedText>” and quoted its previous language about the imminence of the threat necessary to constitute contempt.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081074"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862415584"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862412912"/></p>

United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081075"/> the Court sustained the constitutionality of the Smith Act,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081076"/> which proscribed advocacy of the overthrow by force and violence of the government of the United States, and upheld convictions under it. <inline role="name" class="case">Dennis</inline>’ importance here is in the rewriting of the clear and present danger test. For a plurality of four, Chief Justice Vinson acknowledged that the Court had in recent years relied on the Holmes-Brandeis formulation of clear and present danger without actually overruling the older cases that had rejected the test; but while clear and present danger was the proper constitutional test, that “<quotedText>shorthand phrase should [not] be crystallized into a rigid rule to be applied inflexibly without regard to the circumstances of each case.</quotedText>” It was a relative concept. Many of the cases in which it had been used to reverse convictions had turned “<quotedText>on the fact that the interest which the State was attempting to protect was itself too insubstantial to warrant restriction of speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081077"/></p>
              <p>Here, by contrast, “<quotedText>[o]verthrow of the government by force and violence is certainly a substantial enough interest for the government to limit speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081078"/> And in combating that threat, the government need not wait to act until the putsch is about to be executed and the plans are set for action. “<quotedText>If Government is aware that a group aiming at its overthrow is attempting to indoctrinate its members and to commit them to a course whereby they will strike when the leaders feel the circumstances permit, action by the government is required.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081079"/> Therefore, what does the phrase “<quotedText>clear and present danger</quotedText>” import for judgment? “<quotedText>Chief Judge Learned Hand, writing for the majority below, interpreted the phrase as follows: ‘In each case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the "evil," discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.’ 183 F.2d at 212. We adopt this statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081080"/> The “<quotedText>gravity of the evil, discounted by its improbability</quotedText>” was found to justify the convictions.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081081"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862333456"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871500416"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862327696"/></p>

Douds</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081083"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862267232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862265424"/>There the Court sustained a law barring from access to the NLRB any labor union if any of its officers failed to file annually an oath disclaiming membership in the Communist Party and belief in the violent overthrow of the government.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081084"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862267232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862265424"/>Chief Justice Vinson, for the Court, rejected reliance on the clear and present danger test. “<quotedText>Government’s interest here is not in preventing the dissemination of Communist doctrine or the holding of particular beliefs because it is feared that unlawful action will result therefrom if free speech is practiced. Its interest is in protecting the free flow of commerce from what Congress considers to be substantial evils of conduct that are not the products of speech at all. Section 9(h), in other words, does not interfere with speech because Congress fears the consequences of speech; it regulates harmful conduct which Congress has determined is carried on by persons who may be identified by their political affiliations and beliefs. The Board does not contend that political strikes, the substantive evil at which § 9(h) is aimed, are the present or impending products of advocacy of the doctrines of Communism or the expression of belief in overthrow of the Government by force. On the contrary, it points out that such strikes are called by persons who, so Congress has found, have the will and power to do so <i>without</i> advocacy or persuasion that seeks acceptance in the competition of the market.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081085"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862280032"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51870948400"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870947488"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862291552"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871197120"/>Justice Frankfurter, in his concurring opinion in <inline role="name" class="case">Dennis v. United States</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081088"/> rejected the applicability of clear and present danger and adopted a balancing test. “<quotedText>The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the interest in national security are better served by candid and informed weighing of the competing interest, within the confines of the judicial process, than by announcing dogmas too inflexible for the non-Euclidian problems to be solved.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081089"/> But the “<quotedText>careful weighing of conflicting interests</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081090"/> not only placed in the scale the disparately weighed interest of government in self-preservation and the interest of defendants in advocating illegal action, which alone would have determined the balance, it also involved the Justice’s philosophy of the “<quotedText>confines of the judicial process</quotedText>” within which the role of courts, in First Amendment litigation as in other, is severely limited. Thus, “<quotedText>[f]ull responsibility</quotedText>” may not be placed in the courts “<quotedText>to balance the relevant factors and ascertain which interest in the circumstances [is] to prevail.</quotedText>”“<quotedText>Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society.</quotedText>”Rather, “<quotedText>[p]rimary responsibility for adjusting the interests which compete in the situation before us of necessity belongs to the Congress.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081091"/> Therefore, after considering at some length the factors to be balanced, Justice Frankfurter concluded:“<quotedText>It is not for us to decide how we would adjust the clash of interests which this case presents were the primary responsibility for reconciling it ours. Congress has determined that the danger created by advocacy of overthrow justifies the ensuing restriction on freedom of speech. The determination was made after due deliberation, and the seriousness of the congressional purpose is attested by the volume of legislation passed to effectuate the same ends.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081092"/> Only if the balance struck by the legislature is“<quotedText>outside the pale of fair judgment</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081093"/> could the Court hold that Congress was deprived by the Constitution of the power it had exercised.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081094"/></p>

Required to satisfy the Committee of Bar Examiners that he was of “<quotedText>good moral character,</quotedText>” Konigsberg testified that he did not believe in the violent overthrow of the government and that he had never knowingly been a member of any organization that advocated such action, but he declined to answer any question pertaining to membership in the Communist Party.</p>

Among the limitations, “<quotedText>general regulatory statutes, not intended to control the content of speech but incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise, have not been regarded as the type of law the First or Fourteenth Amendment forbade Congress or the States to pass, when they have been found justified by subordinating valid governmental interests, a prerequisite to constitutionality which has necessarily involved a weighing of the governmental interest involved.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081096"/> The governmental interest involved was the assurance that those admitted to the practice of law were committed to lawful change in society and it was proper for the state to believe that one possessed of “<quotedText>a belief, firm enough to be carried over into advocacy, in the use of illegal means to change the form</quotedText>” of government did not meet the standard of fitness.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081097"/> On the other hand, the First Amendment interest was limited because there was “<quotedText>minimal effect upon free association occasioned by compulsory disclosure</quotedText>” under the circumstances. “<quotedText>There is here no likelihood that deterrence of association may result from foreseeable private action . . . for bar committee interrogations such as this are conducted in private. . . . Nor is there the possibility that the State may be afforded the opportunity for imposing undetectable arbitrary consequences upon protected association . . . for a bar applicant’s exclusion by reason of Communist Party membership is subject to judicial review, including ultimate review by this Court, should it appear that such exclusion has rested on substantive or procedural factors that do not comport with the Federal Constitution.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081098"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862203680"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871268992"/></p>

Robel</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN081105"/> held invalid under the First Amendment a statute that made it unlawful for any member of an organization that the Subversive Activities Control Board had ordered to register to work in a defense establishment.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081106"/> Although Chief Justice Warren for the Court asserted that the vice of the law was that its proscription operated <i xml:lang="la">per se</i>“<quotedText>without any need to establish that an individual’s association poses the threat feared by the Government in proscribing it,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081107"/> the rationale of the decision was not clear and present danger but the existence of less restrictive means by which the governmental interest could be accomplished.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081108"/> In a concluding footnote, the Court said: “<quotedText>It has been suggested that this case should be decided by ‘balancing’ the governmental interests . . . against the First Amendment rights asserted by the appellee. This we decline to do. We recognize that both interests are substantial, but we deem it inappropriate for this Court to label one as being more important or more substantial than the other. Our inquiry is more circumscribed. Faced with a clear conflict between a federal statute enacted in the interests of national security and an individual’s exercise of his First Amendment rights, we have confined our analysis to whether Congress has adopted a constitutional means in achieving its concededly legitimate legislative goal. In making this determination we have found it necessary to measure the validity of the means adopted by Congress against both the goal it has sought to achieve and the specific prohibitions of the First Amendment. But we have in no way ‘balanced’ those respective interests. We have ruled only that the Constitution requires that the conflict between congressional power and individual rights be accommodated by legislation drawn more narrowly to avoid the conflict.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081109"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870948400"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862216192"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870947488"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862213520"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862291552"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871197120"/></p>

But the beginnings of such a philosophy may be gleaned in much earlier cases in which a rule of decision based on a preference for First Amendment liberties was prescribed. Thus, Chief Justice Stone in his famous <inline role="name" class="case">Carolene Products</inline>“<quotedText>footnote 4</quotedText>” suggested that the ordinary presumption of constitutionality that prevailed when economic regulation was in issue might be reversed when legislation is challenged that restricts “<quotedText>those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation,</quotedText>” or that reflects “<quotedText>prejudice against discreet and insular minorities . . . tend[ing] seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081110"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862065280"/>Then, in <inline role="name" class="case">Murdock v. Pennsylvania</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081111"/> in striking down a license tax on religious colporteurs, the Court remarked that “<quotedText>[f]reedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are in a preferred position.</quotedText>”<marker role="index" misc="idm51862065280"/>Two years later the Court indicated that its decision with regard to the constitutionality of legislation regulating individuals is “<quotedText>delicate . . . [especially] where the usual presumption supporting legislation is balanced by the preferred place given in our scheme to the great, the indispensable democratic freedoms secured by the First Amendment. . . . That priority gives these liberties a sanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081112"/> The “<quotedText>preferred-position</quotedText>” language was sharply attacked by Justice Frankfurter in <inline role="name" class="case">Kovacs v.

Vagueness has been the basis for voiding numerous such laws, especially in the fields of loyalty oaths,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081121"/> obscenity and indecency,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081122"/> and restrictions on public demonstrations.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081123"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861920768"/>It is usually combined with the overbreadth doctrine, which focuses on the need for precision in drafting a statute that may affect First Amendment rights;<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081124"/> an overbroad statute that sweeps under its coverage both protected and unprotected speech and conduct will normally be struck down as facially invalid, although in a non-First Amendment situation the Court would simply void its application to protected conduct.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081125"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861981680"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861984320"/></p>

To ensure that these costs do now swallow the social benefits of declaring a law ‘overbroad,’ we have insisted that a law’s application to protected speech be ‘substantial,’ not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the scope of the law’s plainly legitimate applications, before applying the 'strong medicine' of overbreadth invalidation. . . . Rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or to conduct necessarily associated with speech (such as picketing or demonstrating).</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861891200"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861920768"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861850480"/>Out of a concern that is closely related to that behind the overbreadth doctrine, the Court has insisted that when the government seeks to carry out a permissible goal and it has available a variety of effective means to do so, “<quotedText>[i]f the First Amendment means anything, it means that regulating speech must be a last – not first – resort.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081126"/> Thus, the Court applies “<quotedText>strict scrutiny</quotedText>” to content-based regulations of fully protected speech; this means that it requires that such regulations “<quotedText>promote a compelling interest</quotedText>” and use “<quotedText>the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861845232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861850480"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/>With respect to most speech restrictions to which the Court does not apply strict scrutiny, the Court applies intermediate scrutiny; <i>i.e.</i>, scrutiny that is “<quotedText>midway between the 'strict scrutiny' demanded for content-based regulation of speech and the 'rational basis' standard that is applied – under the Equal Protection Clause – to government regulation of nonspeech activities.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861838208"/> Intermediate scrutiny requires that the governmental interest be “<quotedText>significant</quotedText>” or “<quotedText>substantial</quotedText>” or “<quotedText>important</quotedText>” (but not necessarily “<quotedText>compelling</quotedText>”), and it requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored (but not necessarily the least restrictive means to advance the governmental interest). Speech restrictions to which the Court does not apply strict scrutiny include those that are not content-based (time, place, or manner restrictions; incidental restrictions) and those that restrict categories of speech to which the Court accords less than full First Amendment protection (campaign contributions; commercial speech).<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861829248"/> Note that restrictions on expression may be content-based, but will not receive strict scrutiny if they “<quotedText>are <i>justified</i> without reference to the content of the regulated speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861813664"/> Examples are bans on nude dancing, and zoning restrictions on pornographic theaters or bookstores, both of which, although content-based, receive intermediate scrutiny on the ground that they are “<quotedText>aimed at combating crime and other negative secondary effects,</quotedText>” and not at the content of speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861810656"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/>The Court uses tests closely related to one another in free speech cases in which it applies intermediate scrutiny. It has indicated that the test for determining the constitutionality of an incidental restriction on speech “<quotedText>in the last analysis is little, if any, different from the standard applied to time, place, or manner restrictions,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861803168"/> and that “<quotedText>the validity of time, place, or manner restrictions is determined under standards very similar to those applicable in the commercial speech context.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861800496"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/>In addition, the Supreme Court generally requires – even when applying less than strict scrutiny – that, “<quotedText>[w]hen the government defends a regulation on speech as a means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than simply ‘posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured.’ . . . It must demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861795120"/> The Court has held, however, that to sustain a denial of a statute denying minors access to sexually explicit material “<quotedText>requires only that we be able to say that it was not irrational for the legislature to find that exposure to material condemned by the statute is harmful to minors.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861786448"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/>In certain other contexts, the Court has relied on “<quotedText>common sense</quotedText>” rather than requiring the government to demonstrate that a recited harm was real and not merely conjectural. For example, it held that a rule prohibiting high school coaches from recruiting middle school athletes did not violate the First Amendment, finding that it needed “<quotedText>no empirical data to credit [the] common-sense conclusion that hard-sell [speech] tactics directed at middle school students could lead to exploitation . . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861770144"/> On the use of common sense in free speech cases, Justice Souter wrote: “<quotedText>It is not that common sense is always illegitimate in First Amendment demonstration. The need for independent proof varies with the point that has to be established . . . . But we must be careful about substituting common assumptions for evidence when the evidence is as readily available as public statistics and municipal property evaluations, lest we find out when the evidence is gathered that the assumptions are highly debatable.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861767024"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51871500416"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/>Complexities inherent in the myriad varieties of expression encompassed by the First Amendment guarantees of speech, press, and assembly probably preclude any single standard for determining the presence of First Amendment protection. For certain forms of expression for which protection is claimed, the Court engages in “<quotedText>definitional balancing</quotedText>” to determine that those forms are outside the range of protection.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081128"/> Balancing is in evidence to enable the Court to determine whether certain covered speech is entitled to protection in the particular context in which the question arises.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081129"/> Use of vagueness, overbreadth, and less intrusive means may very well operate to reduce the number of occasions when questions of protection must be answered squarely on the merits.<marker role="index" misc="idm51870948400"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870947488"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870874240"/>What is observable, however, is the re-emergence, at least in a tentative fashion, of something like the clear and present danger standard in advocacy cases, which is the context in which it was first developed. Thus, in <inline role="name" class="case">Brandenburg v. Ohio</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081130"/> a conviction under a criminal syndicalism statute of advocating the necessity or propriety of criminal or terrorist means to achieve political change was reversed. The prevailing doctrine developed in the Communist Party cases was that “<quotedText>mere</quotedText>” advocacy was protected but that a call for concrete, forcible action even far in the future was not protected speech and knowing membership in an organization calling for such action was not protected association, regardless of the probability of success.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081131"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Brandenburg</inline>, however, the Court reformulated these and other rulings to mean “<quotedText>that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081132"/> The Court has not revisited these issues since <inline role="name" class="case">Brandenburg</inline>, so the long-term significance of the decision is yet to be determined.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861697936"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870948400"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870947488"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871500416"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870996288"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870874240"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Minersville School District v. Gobitis</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081137"/> the Court had upheld the power of Pennsylvania to expel from its schools certain children – Jehovah’s Witnesses – who refused upon religious grounds to join in a flag salute ceremony and recite the pledge of allegiance. “<quotedText>Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081138"/> But three years later, in <inline role="name" class="case">West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081136"/> a six-to-three majority of the Court overturned <inline role="name" class="case">Gobitis</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081139"/> Justice Jackson, writing for the Court, chose to ignore the religious argument and to ground the decision upon freedom of speech. The state policy, he said, constituted “<quotedText>a compulsion of students to declare a belief. . . . It requires the individual to communicate by word and sign his acceptance of the political ideas [the flag] bespeaks.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081140"/> The power of a state to follow a policy that “<quotedText>requires affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind,</quotedText>” however, is limited by the First Amendment, which, under the standard then prevailing, required the state to prove that for the students to remain passive during the ritual “<quotedText>creates a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081141"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872090160"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872087488"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861654416"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51872290272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861683264"/>The rationale of <marker role="index" misc="idm51862203680"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51872290272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861625232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862267232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861683264"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862265424"/><inline role="name" class="case">Barnette</inline> became the basis for the Court’s decision in <inline role="name" class="case">Wooley v. Maynard</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861618480"/> which voided a requirement by the state of New Hampshire that motorists display passenger vehicle license plates bearing the motto “<quotedText>Live Free or Die.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861616688"/> Acting on the complaint of a Jehovah’s Witness, the Court held that the plaintiff could not be compelled by the state to display a message making an ideological statement on his private property. In a subsequent case, however, the Court found that compelling property owners to facilitate the speech of others by providing access to their property did not violate the First Amendment.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861615312"/> Nor was there a constitutional violation where compulsory fees were used to subsidize the speech of others.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861610912"/></p>
              <p>Other governmental efforts to compel speech have also been held by the Supreme Court to violate the First Amendment; these include a North Carolina statute that required professional fundraisers for charities to disclose to potential donors the gross percentage of revenues retained in prior charitable solicitations,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861594160"/> a Florida statute that required newspapers to grant political candidates equal space to reply to the newspapers' criticism and attacks on their records,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861589088"/> an Ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of anonymous campaign literature,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861584656"/> and a Massachusetts statute that required private citizens who organized a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message – in this case support for gay rights – that the organizers did not wish to convey.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861581840"/></p>
              <p>The principle of <inline role="name" class="case">Barnette</inline>, however, does not extend so far as to bar a government from requiring of its employees or of persons seeking professional licensing or other benefits an oath generally but not precisely based on the oath required of federal officers, which is set out in the Constitution, that the taker of the oath will uphold and defend the Constitution.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081142"/> It is not at all clear, however, to what degree the government is limited in probing the sincerity of the person taking the oath.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081143"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862203680"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861625232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862267232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862265424"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51872290272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861683264"/>By contrast, the Supreme Court has found no First Amendment violation when government compels disclosures in commercial speech, or when it compels the labeling of foreign political propaganda. Regarding compelled disclosures in commercial speech, the Court held that an advertiser's “<quotedText>constitutionally protected interest in <i>not</i> providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal. . . . [A]n advertiser's rights are reasonably protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers. . . . The right of a commercial speaker not to divulge accurate information regarding his services is not . . . a fundamental right.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861539040"/> Regarding compelled labeling of foreign political propaganda, the Court upheld a provision of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 that required that, when an agent of a foreign principal seeks to disseminate foreign “<quotedText>political propaganda,</quotedText>” he must label such material with certain information, including his identity, the principal's identity, and the fact that he has registered with the Department of Justice. The Court found that “<quotedText>Congress did not prohibit, edit, or restrain the distribution of advocacy materials. . . . To the contrary, Congress simply required the disseminators of such material to make additional disclosures that would better enable the public to evaluate the import of the propaganda.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51861531600"/></p>

In the first case, the Court unanimously set aside a contempt citation imposed after the organization refused to comply with a court order to produce a list of its members within the state. “<quotedText>Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081162"/>“<quotedText>[T]hese indispensable liberties, whether of speech, press, or association,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081163"/> may be abridged by governmental action either directly or indirectly, wrote Justice Harlan, and the state had failed to demonstrate a need for the lists which would outweigh the harm to associational rights which disclosure would produce.</p>

First, <inline role="name" class="case">Roberts v. United States Jaycees</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN081177"/> upheld application of the Minnesota Human Rights Act to prohibit the United States Jaycees from excluding women from full membership. Three years later in <inline role="name" class="case">Board of Directors of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081178"/> the Court applied <inline role="name" class="case">Roberts</inline> in upholding application of a similar California law to prevent Rotary International from excluding women from membership. Then, in <inline role="name" class="case">New York State Club Ass’n v. New York City</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081179"/> the Court upheld against facial challenge New York City’s Human Rights Law, which prohibits race, creed, sex, and other discrimination in places “<quotedText>of public accommodation, resort, or amusement,</quotedText>” and applies to clubs of more than 400 members providing regular meal service and supported by nonmembers for trade or business purposes. In <inline role="name" class="case">Roberts</inline>, both the Jaycees’ nearly indiscriminate membership requirements and the state’s compelling interest in prohibiting discrimination against women were important to the Court’s analysis. The Court found that “<quotedText>the local chapters of the Jaycees are large and basically unselective groups,</quotedText>” age and sex being the only established membership criteria in organizations otherwise entirely open to public participation. The Jaycees, therefore, “<quotedText>lack the distinctive characteristics [<i>e.g.</i>, small size, identifiable purpose, selectivity in membership, perhaps seclusion from the public eye] that might afford constitutional protection to the decision of its members to exclude women.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081180"/> Similarly, the Court determined in <inline role="name" class="case">Rotary International</inline> that Rotary Clubs, designed as community service organizations representing a cross section of business and professional occupations, also do not represent “<quotedText>the kind of intimate or private relation that warrants constitutional protection.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081181"/> And, in <inline role="name" class="case">New York City</inline>, the fact “<quotedText>that the antidiscrimination provisions of the Human Rights Law certainly could be constitutionally applied at least to some of the large clubs, under the Court's decisions in <inline role="name" class="case">Rotary</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Roberts</inline>,</quotedText>” and the fact that the clubs were “<quotedText>'commercial' in nature,</quotedText>” helped to defeat the facial challenge.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081182"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51862216192"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862213520"/>Some amount of First Amendment protection is still due such organizations; the Jaycees had taken public positions on a number of issues, and, the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Roberts</inline> noted, “<quotedText>regularly engage[d] in a variety of civic, charitable, lobbying, fundraising, and other activities worthy of constitutional protection under the First Amendment. There is, however, no basis in the record for concluding that admission of women as full voting members will impede the organization’s ability to engage in these protected activities or to disseminate its preferred views.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081183"/> Moreover, the state had a “<quotedText>compelling interest to prevent . . . acts of invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods, services, and other advantages. . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081184"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51862216192"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862213520"/>Because of the near-public nature of the Jaycees and Rotary Clubs – the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Roberts</inline> likening the situation to a large business attempting to discriminate in hiring or in selection of customers – the cases may be limited in application, and should not be read as governing membership discrimination by private social clubs.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081185"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">New York City</inline>, the Court noted that “<quotedText>opportunities for individual associations to contest the constitutionality of the Law as it may be applied against them are adequate to assure that any overbreadth . . . will be curable through case-by-case analysis of specific facts.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081186"/></p>

But even if individual access to the parade might similarly be mandated, the Court reasoned, the gay group “<quotedText>could nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude an applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position taken by the club’s existing members.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081189"/></p>

These rights are circumscribed, however, when the State gives a party a role in the election process – as . . . by giving certain parties the right to have their candidates appear on the general-election ballot. Then, for example, the party's racially discriminatory action may become state action that violates the Fifteenth Amendment.

To compel one to expend funds in such a way is to violate his freedom of belief and the right to act on those beliefs just as much as if government prohibited him from acting to further his own beliefs.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081212"/> The remedy, however, was not to restrain the union from making non-collective-bargaining-related expenditures, but was to require that those funds come only from employees who do not object. Therefore, the lower courts were directed to oversee development of a system under which employees could object generally to such use of union funds and could obtain either a proportionate refund or a reduction of future exactions.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081213"/> Later, the Court further tightened the requirements. A proportionate refund is inadequate because “<quotedText>even then the union obtains an involuntary loan for purposes to which the employee objects</quotedText>”;<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081214"/> an advance reduction of dues corrects the problem only if accompanied by sufficient information by which employees may gauge the propriety of the union’s fee.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081215"/> Therefore, the union procedure must also “<quotedText>provide for a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN081216"/></p>

Service Employees International Union</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860831696"/> the Court did suggest constitutional limits on a public union assessing political fees in an agency shop other than through a voluntary opt in system. The union in <inline role="name" class="case">Knox</inline> had proposed and implemented a special fee to fund political advocacy before providing formal notice with an opportunity for non-union employees to opt out. Five Justices characterized agency shop arrangements in the public sector as constitutionally problematic in the first place, and, then, charged that requiring non-union members to affirmatively opt out of contributing to political activities was “<quotedText>a remarkable boon for unions.</quotedText>” Continuing to call opt-out arrangements impingements on the First Amendment rights of non-union members, the majority more specifically held that the Constitution required that separate notices be sent out for special political assessments that allowed non-union employees to opt in rather than requiring them to opt out.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860828352"/> Two concurring Justices, echoed by the dissenters, heavily criticized the majority for reaching “<quotedText>significant constitutional issues not contained in the questions presented, briefed, or argued.</quotedText>” Rather, the concurrence more narrowly found that unions may not collect special political assesments from non-union members who earlier objected to nonchargeable (<i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, political) expenses, and could only collect from nonobjecting nonmembers after giving notice and an opportunity to opt out.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860826448"/></p>

Instead, the Court focused on the peculiar status of the employees at issue in the case before it: home health care assistants subsidized by Medicaid. These “<quotedText>partial-public employees</quotedText>” were under the direction and control of their individual clients and not the state, had little direct interaction with state agencies or employees, and derived only limited benefits from the union.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860801552"/> As a consequence, the Court concluded that <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Abood</i></inline>'s rationale—the labor peace and free rider concerns—did not justify compelling dissenting home health care assistants to subsidize union speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860798768"/> The question that remains after <inline role="name" class="case">Harris</inline> is whether the Court will, given its open criticism of <inline role="name" class="case">Abood</inline>, overturn the 1977 ruling in the future, or whether the Court will continue to limit <inline role="name" class="case">Abood</inline> to its facts.<marker role="index" misc="idm51860939520"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860938224"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860954912"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862213520"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860953456"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860958560"/><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860786688"/></p>

Because the statute did not restrict political speech, but merely declined to subsidize it by providing for payroll deductions, the state did not abridge the union's First Amendment right and therefore could justify the ban merely by demonstrating a rational basis for it.

Pursuit of this goal may lead government officials at times to trespass in areas protected by the guarantees of speech and press and may require the balancing away of rights that might be preserved inviolate at other times. The drawing of the line is committed, not exclusively but finally, to the Supreme Court. In this section, we consider a number of areas in which the necessity to draw lines has arisen.</p>

Obviously, the words cannot mean that before the government may act, it must wait until the <i>putsch</i> is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited.

The decision was based upon construction of the statute and appraisal of the evidence rather than on First Amendment claims, although each prong of the ruling seems to have been informed with First Amendment considerations. Thus, Justice Harlan for the Court wrote that the trial judge had given faulty instructions to the jury in advising that all advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow was punishable, whether it was language of incitement or not, so long as it was done with an intent to accomplish that purpose. But the statute, the Justice continued, prohibited “<quotedText>advocacy of action,</quotedText>” not merely “<quotedText>advocacy in the realm of ideas.</quotedText>”“<quotedText>The essential distinction is that those to whom the advocacy is addressed must be urged to <i>do</i>something, now or in the future, rather than merely to <i>believe</i> in something.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080054"/> Second, the Court found the evidence insufficient to establish that the Communist Party had engaged in the required advocacy of action, requiring the Government to prove such advocacy in each instance rather than presenting evidence generally about the Party.

For the Court, Chief Justice Warren wrote that a statute that so infringed upon freedom of association must be much more narrowly drawn to take precise account of the evils at which it permissibly could be aimed. One could be disqualified from holding sensitive positions on the basis of active, knowing membership with a specific intent to further the unlawful goals of an organization, but that membership that was passive or inactive, or by a person unaware of the organization’s unlawful aims, or by one who disagreed with those aims, could not be grounds for disqualification, certainly not for a non-sensitive position.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080114"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860538960"/></p>

The system, as interpreted by the state courts, denied the exemption only to persons who engaged in speech that could be criminally punished consistently with the First Amendment, but the Court found the vice of the provision to be that, after each claimant had executed an oath disclaiming his engagement in unlawful speech, the tax assessor could disbelieve the oath taker and deny the exemption, thereby placing on the claimant the burden of proving that he was loyal. “<quotedText>The vice of the present procedure is that, where particular speech falls close to the line separating the lawful and the unlawful, the possibility of mistaken fact-finding – inherent in all litigation – will create the danger that the legitimate utterance will be penalized. The man who knows that he must bring forth proof and persuade another of the lawfulness of his conduct necessarily must steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the State must bear these burdens . . . . In practical operation, therefore, this procedural device must necessarily produce a result which the State could not command directly.

Such programs generally take one of two forms or may combine the two. First, government may establish a system investigating employees or prospective employees under standards relating to presumed loyalty. Second, government may require its employees or prospective employees to subscribe to a loyalty oath disclaiming belief in or advocacy of, or membership in an organization that stands for or advocates, unlawful or disloyal action. The Federal Government’s security investigation program has been tested numerous times and First Amendment issues raised, but the Supreme Court has never squarely confronted the substantive constitutional issues, and it has not dealt with the loyalty oath features of the federal program.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080134"/> The Court has, however, had a long running encounter with state loyalty oath programs.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080138"/></p>

Accepting the state court construction that the law required each candidate to “<quotedText>make oath that he is not a person who is engaged ‘in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by <i>force or violence</i>,’ and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt,</quotedText>” the Court unanimously sustained the provision in a one-paragraph <i xml:lang="la">per curiam</i> opinion.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080146"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860432176"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860423040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860419072"/> Less than two months later, the Court upheld a requirement that employees take an oath that they had not within a prescribed period advised, advocated, or taught the overthrow of government by unlawful means, nor been a member of an organization with similar objectives; every employee was also required to swear that he was not and had not been a member of the Communist Party.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080150"/> For the Court, Justice Clark perceived no problem with the inquiry into Communist Party membership but cautioned that no issue had been raised whether an employee who was or had been a member could be discharged merely for that reason.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080154"/>With regard to the oath, the Court did not discuss First Amendment considerations but stressed that it believed the appropriate authorities would not construe the oath adversely against persons who were innocent of an organization’s purpose during their affiliation, or persons who had severed their associations upon knowledge of an organization’s purposes, or persons who had been members of an organization at a time when it was not unlawfully engaged.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080158"/> Otherwise, the oath requirement was valid as “<quotedText>a reasonable regulation to protect the municipal service by establishing an employment qualification of loyalty</quotedText>” and as being “<quotedText>reasonably designed to protect the integrity and competency of the service.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080162"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080194"/> it unanimously held an oath too vague that required one to swear, <i xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>, that “<quotedText>I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party.</quotedText>” Similarly, in <inline role="name" class="case">Baggett v.

Although couched in vagueness terms, the Court’s opinion stressed that the vagueness was compounded by its effect on First Amendment rights and seemed to emphasize that the state could not deny employment to one simply because he unintentionally lent indirect aid to the cause of violent overthrow by engaging in lawful activities that he knew might add to the power of persons supporting illegal overthrow.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080202"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861981680"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861984320"/></p>

Russell</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080206"/>involved an oath that as supplemented would have been violated by one who “<quotedText>knowingly and willfully becomes or remains a member of the communist party . . . or any other organization having for its purposes the overthrow by force or violence of the government</quotedText>” with “<quotedText>knowledge of said unlawful purpose of said organization.</quotedText>” The law’s blanketing in of “<quotedText>knowing but guiltless</quotedText>” membership was invalid, wrote Justice Douglas for the Court, because one could be a knowing member but not subscribe to the illegal goals of the organization; moreover, it appeared that one must also have participated in the unlawful activities of the organization before public employment could be denied.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080210"/> Next, in <inline role="name" class="case">Keyishian v. Board of Regents</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080214"/> the oath provisions sustained in <inline role="name" class="case">Adler</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080218"/> were declared unconstitutional. A number of provisions were voided as vague,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080222"/> but the Court held invalid a new provision making Communist Party membership <i xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> evidence of disqualification for employment because the opportunity to rebut the presumption was too limited. It could be rebutted only by denying membership, denying knowledge of advocacy of illegal overthrow, or denying that the organization advocates illegal overthrow. But “<quotedText>legislation which sanctions membership unaccompanied by specific intent to further the unlawful goals of the organization or which is not active membership violates constitutional limitations.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080226"/> Similarly, in <inline role="name" class="case">Whitehill v.

            <p>Congress may bar supporting the legitimate activities of certain foreign terrorist organizations through speech made to, under the direction of, or in coordination with those groups. So held the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860084976"/> a case challenging an effective prohibition on giving training in peaceful dispute resolution, teaching how to petition the United Nations for relief, providing legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements, and the like.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860082752"/> Without express reliance on wartime precedents, and yet also without extended discussion of plaintiffs' free speech interests, the Court emphasized findings by the political branches that support meant to promote peaceful conduct can nevertheless further terrorism by designated groups in multiple ways. The Court also cited the narrowness of the proscription imposed. Only carefully defined activities done in concert with previously designated organizations were barred. Independent advocacy and mere membership were not restricted. Given the national security and foreign affairs concerns at stake, Congress had adequately balanced the competing interests of individual speech and government regulation, deference to the informed judgment of the political branches being due even absent an extensive record of concrete evidence.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51860079008"/></p>

            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/>Government adopts and enforces many measures that are designed to further a valid interest but that may restrict freedom of expression. As an employer, government is interested in attaining and maintaining full production from its employees in a harmonious environment. As enforcer of the democratic method of carrying out the selection of public officials, it is interested in outlawing “<quotedText>corrupt practices</quotedText>” and promoting a fair and smoothly functioning electoral process. As regulator of economic affairs, its interests are extensive. As educator, it desires to impart knowledge and training to the young with as little distraction as possible. All these interests may be achieved with some restriction upon expression, but, if the regulation goes too far, then it will violate the First Amendment.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080314"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/></p>

In 1876, federal employees were prohibited from requesting from, giving to, or receiving from any other federal employee money for political purposes, and the Civil Service Act of 1883 more broadly forbade civil service employees to use their official authority or influence to coerce political action of any person or to interfere with elections.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080318"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860039008"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860036736"/>By the Hatch Act, federal employees, and many state employees as well, are forbidden to “<quotedText>take any active part in political management or in political campaigns.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080322"/> As applied through the regulations and rulings of the Office of Personnel Management, formerly the Civil Service Commission, the Act prevents employees from running for public office, distributing campaign literature, playing an active role at political meetings, circulating nomination petitions, attending a political convention except as a spectator, publishing a letter soliciting votes for a candidate, and all similar activity.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080326"/> The question is whether government, which may not prohibit citizens in general from engaging in these activities, may nonetheless so control the off-duty activities of its own employees.</p>

Mitchell</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080330"/> the Court answered in the affirmative. While the Court refused to consider the claims of persons who had not yet engaged in forbidden political activities, it ruled against a mechanical employee of the Mint who had done so. The Court’s opinion, by Justice Reed, recognized that the restrictions of political activities imposed by the Act did in some measure impair First Amendment and other constitutional rights,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080334"/> but it based its decision upon the established principle that no right is absolute. The standard by which the Court judged the validity of the permissible impairment of First Amendment rights was a due process standard of reasonableness.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080338"/> Thus, changes in the standards of judging incidental restrictions on expression suggested the possibility of a reconsideration of <inline role="name" class="case">Mitchell</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080342"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers</inline>, however, a divided Court, reaffirming <inline role="name" class="case">Mitchell</inline>, sustained the Act’s limitations upon political activity against a range of First Amendment challenges.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080346"/> The Court emphasized that the interest of the government in forbidding partisan political activities by its employees was so substantial that it overrode the rights of those employees to engage in political activities and association;<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080350"/> therefore, a statute that barred in plain language a long list of activities would clearly be valid.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080354"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/> The issue in <inline role="name" class="case">Letter Carriers</inline>, however, was whether the language that Congress had enacted, forbidding employees to take “<quotedText>an active part in political management or in political campaigns,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859987680"/> was unconstitutional on its face, either because the statute was too imprecise to allow government employees to determine what was forbidden and what was permitted, or because the statute swept in under its coverage conduct that Congress could not forbid as well as conduct subject to prohibition or regulation. With respect to vagueness, plaintiffs contended and the lower court had held that the quoted proscription was inadequate to provide sufficient guidance and that the only further elucidation Congress had provided was in a section stating that the forbidden activities were the same activities that the Commission had as of 1940, and reaching back to 1883, “<quotedText>determined are at the time of the passage of this act prohibited on the part of employees . . . by the provisions of the civil-service rules. . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859985808"/> This language had been included, it was contended, to deprive the Commission of power to alter thousands of rulings it had made that were not available to employees and that were in any event mutually inconsistent and too broad.<marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/></p>

The Commission had done that. It had regularly summarized in understandable terms the rules that it applied, and it was authorized as well to issue advisory opinions to employees uncertain of the propriety of contemplated conduct. “<quotedText>[T]here are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief,</quotedText>” said the Court, but it thought the prohibitions as elaborated in Commission regulations and rulings were “<quotedText>set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interests.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080358"/> There were conflicts, the Court conceded, between some of the things forbidden and some of the protected expressive activities, but these were at most marginal.<marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/> Thus, some conduct arguably protected did under some circumstances so partake of partisan activities as to be properly proscribable. But the Court would not invalidate the entire statute for this degree of overbreadth.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080362"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/> Subsequently, in <inline role="name" class="case">Bush v. Lucas</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080366"/> the Court held that the civil service laws and regulations constitute a sufficiently “<quotedText>elaborate, comprehensive scheme</quotedText>” to afford federal employees an adequate remedy for deprivation of First Amendment rights as a result of disciplinary actions by supervisors, and that therefore there is no need to create an additional judicial remedy for the constitutional violation.</p>

The honoraria ban suppressed employees’ right to free expression while the Hatch Act sought to protect that right, and also there was no evidence of improprieties in acceptance of honoraria by members of the plaintiff class of federal employees.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080374"/> The Court emphasized further difficulties with the “<quotedText>crudely crafted</quotedText>” honoraria ban: it was limited to expressive activities and had no application to other sources of outside income, it applied when neither the subjects of speeches and articles nor the persons or groups paying for them bore any connection to the employee’s job responsibilities, and it exempted a “<quotedText>series</quotedText>” of speeches or articles without also exempting individual articles and speeches. These “<quotedText>anomalies</quotedText>” led the Court to conclude that the “<quotedText>speculative benefits</quotedText>” of the ban were insufficient to justify the burdens it imposed on expressive activities.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080378"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51862216192"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860049040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860039008"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861158656"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860036736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860044144"/></p>

Application of that distinction to the public employment context was epitomized in the famous sentence of Justice Holmes’: “<quotedText>The petitioner may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080382"/> The Supreme Court embraced this application in the early 1950s, first affirming a lower court decision by an evenly divided vote,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080386"/> and soon after applying the distinction itself. <marker role="index" misc="idm51870901728"/>Upholding a prohibition on employment as teachers of persons who advocated the desirability of overthrowing the government, the Court declared that “<quotedText>[i]t is clear that such persons have the right under our law to assemble, speak, think and believe as they will. . . . It is equally clear that they have no right to work for the state in the school system on their own terms. They may work for the school system under reasonable terms laid down by the proper authorities of New York. If they do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their beliefs and associations and go elsewhere. Has the State thus deprived them of any right to free speech or assembly? We think not.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080390"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51870901728"/></p>

Voiding a loyalty oath requirement conditioned on mere membership in suspect organizations, the Court reasoned that the interest of public employees in being free of such an imposition was substantial. “<quotedText>There can be no dispute about the consequences visited upon a person excluded from public employment on disloyalty grounds. In the view of the community, the stain is a deep one; indeed, it has become a badge of infamy. . . . [W]e need not pause to consider whether an abstract right to public employment exists. It is sufficient to say that constitutional protection does extend to the public servant whose exclusion pursuant to a statute is patently arbitrary or discriminatory.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080394"/> The premise here – that there is a constitutional claim against dismissal or rejection – has faded in subsequent cases; the rationale now is that, although government may deny employment, or any benefit for that matter, for any number of reasons, it may not deny employment or other benefits on a basis that infringes a person’s constitutionally protected interests. “<quotedText>For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to ‘produce a result which [it] could not command directly.’ Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080398"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861503824"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860532496"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51859921472"/></p>

Board of Education</inline>, “<quotedText>that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080402"/><inline role="name" class="case">Pickering</inline> concerned the dismissal of a high school teacher who had written a critical letter to a local newspaper reflecting on the administration of the school system. The letter also contained several factual errors. “<quotedText>The problem in any case,</quotedText>” Justice Marshall wrote for the Court, “<quotedText>is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080406"/> The Court laid down no general standard, but undertook a suggestive analysis. Dismissal of a public employee for criticism of his superiors was improper, the Court indicated, where the relationship of employee to superior was not so close, such as day-to-day personal contact, that problems of discipline or of harmony among coworkers, or problems of personal loyalty and confidence, would arise.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080410"/> The school board had not shown that any harm had resulted from the false statements in the letter, and it could not proceed on the assumption that the false statements were per se harmful, inasmuch as the statements primarily reflected a difference of opinion between the teacher and the board about the allocation of funds. Moreover, the allocation of funds is a matter of important public concern about which teachers have informed and definite opinions that the community should be aware of. “<quotedText>In these circumstances we conclude that the interest of the school administration in limiting teachers’ opportunities to contribute to public debate is not significantly greater than its interest in limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080414"/></p>

Kennedy</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080418"/> sustained the constitutionality of a federal law that authorized the removal or suspension without pay of an employee “<quotedText>for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service</quotedText>” when the “<quotedText>cause</quotedText>” cited concerned speech by the employee. He had charged that his superiors had made an offer of a bribe to a private person. The quoted statutory phrase, the Court held, “<quotedText>is without doubt intended to authorize dismissal for speech as well as other conduct.</quotedText>” But, recurring to its <inline role="name" class="case">Letter Carriers</inline> analysis,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080422"/> it noted that the authority conferred was not impermissibly vague, inasmuch as it is not possible to encompass within a statutory enactment all the myriad situations that arise in the course of employment, and inasmuch as the language used was informed by developed principles of agency adjudication coupled with a procedure for obtaining legal counsel from the agency on the interpretation of the law.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080426"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/> Nor was the language overbroad, continued the Court, because it “<quotedText>proscribes only that public speech which improperly damages and impairs the reputation and efficiency of the employing agency, and it thus imposes no greater controls on the behavior of federal employees than are necessary for the protection of the government as an employer. . . . We hold that the language ‘such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service’ in the Act excludes constitutionally protected speech, and that the statute is therefore not overbroad.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080430"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51861922688"/></p>

The employee, an assistant district attorney involved in a dispute with her supervisor over transfer to a different section, was fired for insubordination after she circulated a questionnaire among her peers soliciting views on matters relating to employee morale. The Court found this firing permissible. “<quotedText>When employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080438"/> Whether an employee’s speech addresses a matter of public concern, the Court indicated, must be determined not only by its content, but also by its form and context.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080442"/> Because one aspect of the employee’s speech did raise matters of public concern, <inline role="name" class="case">Connick</inline>also applied <inline role="name" class="case">Pickering</inline><i>’s</i> balancing test, holding that “<quotedText>a wide degree of deference is appropriate</quotedText>” when “<quotedText>close working relationships</quotedText>” between employer and employee are involved.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080446"/> The issue of public concern is not only a threshold inquiry, but, under <inline role="name" class="case">Connick</inline>, still figures in the balancing of interests: “<quotedText>the State’s burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee’s expression</quotedText>” and its importance to the public.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080450"/></p>

Des Moines Independent Community School District</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080494"/> There, high school principals had banned the wearing of black armbands by students in school as a symbol of protest against United States' actions in Vietnam. Reversing the refusal of lower courts to reinstate students who had been suspended for violating the ban, the Court set out the balance to be drawn. “<quotedText>First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. . . . On the other hand, the Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080498"/> Restriction on expression by school authorities is only permissible to prevent disruption of educational discipline. “<quotedText>In order for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in the forbidden conduct would ‘materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,’ the prohibition cannot be sustained.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080502"/></p>

James</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080506"/> in which it held that the withholding of recognition by a public college administration from a student organization violated the students’ right of association, which is implicit in the First Amendment. Denial of recognition, the Court held, was impermissible if it had been based on the local organization’s affiliation with the national SDS, or on disagreement with the organization’s philosophy, or on a fear of disruption with no evidentiary support. Furthermore, the Court wrote,“<quotedText>the precedents of this Court leave no room for the view that, because of the acknowledged need for order, First Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large. Quite to the contrary, ‘[t]he vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.’ . . . The college classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the ‘market place of ideas,’ and we break no new constitutional ground in reaffirming this Nation’s dedication to safeguarding academic freedom.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080510"/> A college administration may, however, impose a requirement “<quotedText>that a group seeking offical recognition affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080514"/></p>

Thus, it was constitutionally impermissible for a college to close off its facilities, otherwise open, to students wishing to engage in religious speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080518"/></p>
              <p> While it is unclear whether this holding would extend beyond the college level to students in high school or below who are more “<quotedText>impressionable</quotedText>” and perhaps less able to appreciate that equal access does not compromise a school’s neutrality toward religion,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859486800"/> Congress has done so by statute.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859482704"/>On the other hand, a public university that imposed an “<quotedText>accept-all-comers</quotedText>” policy on student groups as a condition of receiving the financial and other benefits of official school recognition did not impair a student religious group's right to expressive association, because the school's policy was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859479136"/></p>

The plurality conceded that school boards must be permitted “<quotedText>to establish and apply their curriculum in such a way as to transmit community values,</quotedText>” and that “<quotedText>there is a legitimate and substantial community interest in promoting respect for authority and traditional values be they social, moral, or political.</quotedText>” At the same time, the plurality thought that students retained substantial free-speech protections and that among these was the right to receive information and ideas. Carefully limiting its discussion to the removal of books from a school library, and excluding the question of the acquisition of books as well as questions of school curricula, the plurality held a school board constitutionally disabled from removing library books in order to deny access to ideas with which it disagrees for political reasons.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080538"/> The four dissenters rejected the contention that school children have a right to receive information and ideas and thought that the proper role of education was to inculcate the community’s values, a function into which the federal courts could rarely intrude.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080542"/> The decision provides little guidance to school officials and to the lower courts and may necessitate a revisiting of the controversy by the Supreme Court.<marker role="index" misc="idm51859471296"/></p>

Kuhlmeier</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080546"/> in which it relied on public forum analysis to hold that editorial control and censorship of a student newspaper sponsored by a public high school need be only “<quotedText>reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080550"/>“<quotedText>The question whether the First Amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student speech – the question that we addressed in <inline role="name" class="case">Tinker</inline> – is different from the question whether the First Amendment requires a school affirmatively to promote particular student speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080554"/> The student newspaper had been created by school officials as a part of the school curriculum, and served “<quotedText>as a supervised learning experience for journalism students.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859442400"/> Because no public forum had been created, school officials could maintain editorial control subject only to a reasonableness standard. Thus, a principal’s decision to excise from the publication an article describing student pregnancy in a manner believed inappropriate for younger students, and another article on divorce critical of a named parent, were upheld.</p>

School-sponsored activities, the Court indicated, can include “<quotedText>publications, theatrical productions, and other expressive activities that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.

It may be, for example, that students are protected for off-premises production of “<quotedText>underground</quotedText>” newspapers (but not necessarily for attempted distribution on school grounds) as well as for non-disruptive symbolic speech. For most student speech at public schools, however, <inline role="name" class="case">Tinker</inline><i>’s</i> tilt in favor of student expression, requiring school administrators to premise censorship on likely disruptive effects, has been replaced by <inline role="name" class="case">Kuhlmeier</inline><i>’s</i> tilt in favor of school administrators’ pedagogical discretion.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080566"/></p>

As such, the regulation must be subjected to close scrutiny and justified by compelling governmental interests. </p>

The contribution limitation was seen as imposing only a marginal restriction upon the contributor’s ability to engage in free communication, inasmuch as the contribution shows merely a generalized expression of support for a candidate without communicating reasons for the support; “<quotedText>the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributors’ support for the candidate.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080602"/> The political expression really occurs when the funds are spent by a candidate; only if the restrictions were set so low as to impede this communication would there arise a constitutional infringement.

Though the Court treated the restricted spending as purely an expenditure, the activity seems to partake equally of the nature of a contribution spent on behalf of a candidate (although not given to him or her directly).

In <inline role="name" class="case">Davis v.

The statute, the Court wrote, imposed “<quotedText>a special and potentially significant burden</quotedText>” on a candidate “<quotedText>who robustly exercises [his] First Amendment right.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859185968"/> Citing <inline role="name" class="case">Buckley</inline>, the Court stated that a burden “<quotedText>on the expenditure of personal funds is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption.</quotedText>” This is because “<quotedText>reliance on personal funds <i>reduces</i> the threat of corruption, and therefore . . . discouraging use of personal funds[ ] disserves the anticorruption interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859181520"/> Citing <inline role="name" class="case">Buckley</inline> again, the Court added that the governmental interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates does not provide a justification for restricting expenditures, and, in fact, to restrict expenditures “<quotedText>has ominous implications because it would permit Congress to arrogate the voters' authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office. . . . Different candidates have different strengths. Some are wealthy; others have wealthy supporters who are willing to make large contributions.

              <p>A related question is whether the government violates the First Amendment rights of a candidate running a privately funded campaign when it provides public “<quotedText>equalization</quotedText>” funds to opposition candidates. In <inline role="name" class="case">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859172384"/> the Court considered an Arizona voluntary public financing system which granted an initial allotment to the campaigns of candidates for state office who agreed to certain requirements and limitations.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859171008"/> In addition, matching funds were made available to the campaign if the expenditures of a privately financed opposing candidate, combined with the expenditures of any independent groups supporting that opposing candidacy, exceeded the campaign's initial allotment. Citing <inline role="name" class="case">Davis</inline>, the Court found the scheme unconstitutional because it forced the privately financed candidate to “<quotedText>shoulder a special and potentially significant burden</quotedText>” in choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his candidacy.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859168368"/> Although the dissent argued that the provision of benefits to one speaker had not previously been considered by the Court as a significant burden to another,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859164352"/> the majority distinguished those cases as not having involved the provision of subsidies to directly counter the triggering speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859163648"/></p>

Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign Committee</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080630"/> in which the Court held that the minor party had established the requisite showing of likely reprisals through proof of past governmental and private hostility and harassment. Disclosure of recipients of campaign expenditures, the Court reasoned, could not only dissuade supporters and workers who might receive reimbursement for expenses, but could also dissuade various entities from performing routine commercial services for the party and thereby “<quotedText>cripple a minor party’s ability to operate effectively.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080634"/></p>
              <p>The Court has apparently extended the reasoning of these cases to include not just disclosure related to political contributions, but also to disclosure related to legally “<quotedText>qualifying</quotedText>” a measure for the ballot. In <inline role="name" class="case">Doe v.

The case was remanded, however, to ascertain whether in this particular instance (a referendum to overturn a law conferring rights to gay couples) there was a “<quotedText>reasonable probability</quotedText>” that the compelled disclosures would subject the signatories to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51859102496"/></p>

Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080670"/> holding the section’s requirement that independent expenditures be financed by voluntary contributions to a PAC unconstitutional as applied to a corporation organized to promote political ideas, having no stockholders, and not serving as a front for a “<quotedText>business corporation</quotedText>” or union. The Court found that one of the rationales for the special rules on corporate participation in elections – elimination of “<quotedText>the potential for unfair deployment of [corporate] wealth for political purposes</quotedText>” – had no applicability to a corporation “<quotedText>formed to disseminate political ideas, not to amass capital.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080674"/> The other principal rationale – protection of corporate shareholders and other contributors from having their money used to support political candidates to whom they may be opposed – was also deemed inapplicable. The Court distinguished <inline role="name" class="case">National Right to Work Committee</inline> because “<quotedText>restrictions on contributions require less compelling justification than restrictions on independent spending,</quotedText>” and also explained that, “<quotedText>given a contributor’s awareness of the political activity of [MCFL], as well as the readily available remedy of refusing further donations, the interest protecting contributors is simply insufficient to support § 441b’s restriction on . . . independent spending.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080678"/> What the Court did not address directly was whether the same analysis could have led to a different result in <inline role="name" class="case">National Right to Work Committee</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080682"/></p>

Michigan State Chamber of Commerce</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080686"/> in which the Court upheld application to a nonprofit corporation of Michigan’s restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations. The Michigan law, like federal law, prohibited such expenditures from corporate treasury funds, but allowed them to be made from a corporation's PAC funds. This arrangement, the Court decided, serves the state’s compelling interest in ensuring that expenditure of corporate wealth, accumulated with the help of special advantages conferred by state law, does not “<quotedText>distort</quotedText>” the election process.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858910752"/> The law was sufficiently “<quotedText>narrowly tailored</quotedText>” because it permits corporations to make independent political expenditures through segregated funds that “<quotedText>accurately reflect contributors’ support for the corporation’s political views.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080690"/> Also, the Court concluded that the Chamber of Commerce was unlike the MCFL in each of the three distinguishing features that had justified an exemption from operation of the federal law. Unlike MCFL, the Chamber was not organized solely to promote political ideas; although it had no stockholders, the Chamber’s members had similar disincentives to forgo benefits of membership in order to protest the Chamber’s political expression; and, by accepting corporate contributions, the Chamber could serve as a conduit for corporations to circumvent prohibitions on direct corporate contributions and expenditures.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080694"/></p>

The case began as another as-applied challenge to BCRA, but the Court asked for reargument, and, in a 5-4 decision, not only struck down the limitations on electioneering communication on its face (overruling <inline role="name" class="case">McConnell</inline>) but also rejected the use of the antidistortion rationale (overruling <inline role="name" class="case">Austin</inline>). </p>

Reasoning that the Court had rejected similar attempts to level the playing field among differing voices with disparate economic resources,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858752944"/> the Court held that the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker’s identity of necessity prevents distinctions based on wealth.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858747424"/> In particular, the Court noted that media corporations, although statutorily exempted from these restrictions, do not receive special constitutional protection under the First Amendment,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858739632"/>and thus would be constitutionally vulnerable under an antidistortion rationale.</p>
              <p>The Court also held that the ability of a corporation to form a PAC neither allowed that corporation to speak directly, nor did it provide a sufficient alternative method of speech. The Court, found that PACs are burdensome alternatives that are “<quotedText>expensive to administer and are subject to extensive regulation.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858737392"/> The Court noted that the difficulty in establishing a PAC might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in the country have PACs.

              <p>While the holding of <inline role="name" class="case">Citizens United</inline> would appear to diminish the need for corporations to create PACs in order to engage in political speech, it is not clear what level of regulation will now be allowed over speech made directly by a corporation.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858733536"/> The Court did uphold the requirements under BCRA that electioneering communications funded by anyone other than a candidate must include a disclaimer regarding who is responsible for the content of the communication, and that the person making the expenditure must disclose to the FEC the amount of the expenditure and the names of certain contributors. The Court held that these requirements could be justified based on a governmental interest in “<quotedText>provid[ing] the electorate with information</quotedText>” about the sources of election-related spending, helping citizens “<quotedText>make informed choices in the political marketplace,</quotedText>” and facilitate the ability of shareholders to hold corporations accountable for such political speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858730208"/></p>

Difficulties would arise as well in identifying who should have the privilege and who should not.

One of the most difficult to resolve is the conflict between a criminal defendant’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial and the First Amendment’s protection of the rights to obtain and publish information about defendants and trials. Convictions obtained in the context of prejudicial pre-trial publicity<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080778"/> and during trials that were media “<quotedText>spectaculars</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080782"/> have been reversed, but the prevention of such occurrences is of paramount importance to the governmental and public interest in the finality of criminal trials and the successful prosecution of criminals. However, the imposition of “<quotedText>gag orders</quotedText>” on press publication of information directly confronts the First Amendment’s bar on prior restraints,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080786"/> although the courts have a good deal more discretion in preventing the information from becoming public in the first place.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080790"/> Perhaps the most profound debate that has arisen in recent years concerns the right of access of the public and the press to trial and pre-trial proceedings, and the Court has addressed the issue.</p>

This openness, moreover, was no “<quotedText>quirk of history</quotedText>” but “<quotedText>an indispensable attribute of an Anglo-American trial.</quotedText>” This characteristic flowed from the public interest in seeing fairness and proper conduct in the administration of criminal trials; the “<quotedText>therapeutic value</quotedText>” to the public of seeing its criminal laws in operation, purging the society of the outrage felt at the commission of many crimes, convincingly demonstrated why the tradition had developed and been maintained. Thus, “<quotedText>a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our system of justice.</quotedText>” The presumption has more than custom to command it. “<quotedText>[I]n the context of trials . . . the First Amendment guarantees of speech and press, standing alone, prohibit government from summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time that amendment was adopted.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080810"/></p>

In his view, “<quotedText>the First Amendment . . . has a <i>structural</i> role to play in securing and fostering our republican system of self-government. Implicit in this structural role is not only ‘the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,’ but the antecedent assumption that valuable public debate – as well as other civic behavior – must be informed. The structural model links the First Amendment to that process of communication necessary for a democracy to survive, and thus entails solicitude not only for communication itself but also for the indispensable conditions of meaningful communication.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51858473648"/></p>

That standard was developed two years later. <inline role="name" class="case">Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080818"/> involved a statute, unique to one state, that mandated the exclusion of the public and the press from trials during the testimony of a sex-crime victim under the age of 18. For the Court, Justice Brennan wrote that the First Amendment guarantees press and public access to criminal trials, both because of the tradition of openness<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080822"/> and because public scrutiny of a criminal trial serves the valuable functions of enhancing the quality and safeguards of the integrity of the factfinding process, of fostering the appearance of fairness, and of permitting public participation in the judicial process. The right is not absolute, but in order to close all or part of a trial government must show that “<quotedText>the denial is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest, and [that it] is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080826"/> The Court was explicit that the right of access was to <i>criminal</i> trials,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080830"/> so that the question of the openness of civil trials remains.</p>

The Court determined in <inline role="name" class="case">Press-Enterprise I</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080834"/> that historically <i xml:lang="la">voir dire</i> had been open to the public, and that “<quotedText>[t]he presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080838"/> No such findings had been made by the state court, which had ordered closed, in the interest of protecting the privacy interests of some prospective jurors, 41 of the 44 days of <i xml:lang="la">voir dire</i> in a rape-murder case. The trial court also had not considered the possibility of less restrictive alternatives, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>in camera</i> consideration of jurors’ requests for protection from publicity. In <inline role="name" class="case">Waller v. Georgia</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080841"/> the Court held that “<quotedText>under the Sixth Amendment any closure of a suppression hearing over the objections of the accused must meet the tests set out in <inline role="name" class="case">Press Enterprise</inline>,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080844"/> and noted that the need for openness at suppression hearings “<quotedText>may be particularly strong</quotedText>” because the conduct of police and prosecutor is often at issue.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080847"/>And, in <inline role="name" class="case">Press Enterprise II</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080850"/> the Court held that there is a similar First Amendment right of the public to access to most criminal proceedings (here a preliminary hearing) even when the accused requests that the proceedings be closed. Thus, an accused’s Sixth Amendment-based request for closure must meet the same stringent test applied to governmental requests to close proceedings: there must be “<quotedText>specific findings . . . demonstrating that first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant’s fair trial rights.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080853"/> Openness of preliminary hearings was deemed important because, under California law, the hearings can be “<quotedText>the final and most important step in the criminal proceeding</quotedText>” and therefore may be “<quotedText>the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system,</quotedText>” and also because the safeguard of a jury is unavailable at preliminary hearings.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080856"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51858620560"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51858545264"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871131904"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51858543888"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871127840"/></p>

Under this framework, the Court held, regulation of mail must further an important interest unrelated to the suppression of expression; regulation must be shown to further the substantial interest of security, order, and rehabilitation; and regulation must not be used simply to censor opinions or other expressions.

The tours were open to the press, but cameras and recording devices were not permitted, there was no opportunity to talk to inmates, and the tours did not include the maximum security area about which much of the controversy centered.

The distinction between these two closely related principles seemed, initially at least, to hinge on the severity and pervasiveness of the restriction placed on exercise of First Amendment rights. What has emerged is the principle that Congress may condition the receipt of federal funds on acceptance of speech limitations on persons working for the project receiving the federal funding – even if the project also receives non-federal funds – provided that the speech limitations do not extend to the use of non-federal funds outside of the federally funded project. In <inline role="name" class="case">Regan v. Taxation With Representation</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080910"/> the Court held that Congress could constitutionally limit tax-exempt status under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to charitable organizations that do not engage in lobbying. “<quotedText>Congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys,</quotedText>” the Court concluded.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080913"/> The effect of the ruling on the organization’s lobbying activities was minimal, however, since it could continue to receive tax-deductible contributions by creating a separate affiliate to conduct the lobbying.</p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">All. for Open Soc'y Int'l</inline>, organizations that received federal dollars to combat HIV/AIDS internationally were required (1) to ensure that such funds were not being used “<quotedText>to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking</quotedText>” and (2) to have a policy “<quotedText>explicitly opposing prostitution.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857991568"/> While the first condition legitimately ensured that the government was not funding speech which conflicted with the purposes of the grant, the second requirement, in the view of the Court, improperly affected the recipient's protected conduct outside of the federal program.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857990624"/> Further, the Court concluded that the organization could not, as in previous cases, avoid the requirement by establishing an affiliate to engage in opposing advocacy because of the “<quotedText>evident hypocrisy</quotedText>” that would entail.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857987392"/></p>

If a case was underway when such a challenge became apparent, the attorney had to withdraw. The Court distinguished this situation from that in <inline role="name" class="case">Rust v.

The plurality, citing <inline role="name" class="case">Rust v.

This sort of recruiting assistance, however, is a far cry from the compelled speech in <inline role="name" class="case">Barnette</inline> and <inline role="name" class="case">Wooley</inline>. . . .

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51857922896"/>As an outgrowth of the government subsidy cases, such as <inline role="name" class="case">Rust v. Sullivan</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857920816"/>the Court has established the “<quotedText>government speech doctrine</quotedText>” that recognizes that a government entity “<quotedText>is entitled to say what it wishes</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857918848"/>and to select the views that it wants to express.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857916480"/>In this vein, when the government speaks, the government is not barred by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment from determining the content of what it says and can engage in viewpoint discrimination.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857915232"/>The underlying rationale for the government speech doctrine is that the government could not “<quotedText>function</quotedText>” if the government could not favor or disfavor points of view in enforcing a program.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857910192"/> And the Supreme Court has recognized that the government speech doctrine even extends to when the government receives private assistance in helping deliver a government controlled message.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857907856"/> As a consequence, the Court, relying on the government speech doctrine, has rejected First Amendment challenges to (1) regulations prohibiting recipients of government funds from advocating, counseling, or referring patients for abortion;<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857905040"/>(2) disciplinary actions taken as a result of statements made by public employees pursuant to their official duties;<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857902080"/>(3) mandatory assessments made against cattle merchants when used to fund advertisements whose message was controlled by the government;<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857899408"/>(4) a city’s decision to reject a monument for placement in a public park;<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857896368"/> and (5) a state’s decision to reject a design for a specialty license plate for an automobile.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857893296"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51857922896"/>A central issue prompted by the government speech doctrine is determining when speech is that of the government, which can be difficult when the government utilizes or relies on private parties to relay a particular message. In <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association</i></inline>, the Court held that the First Amendment did not prohibit the compelled subsidization of advertisements promoting the sale of beef because the underlying message of the advertisements was “<quotedText>effectively controlled</quotedText>” by the government.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857886496"/>Four years later, in <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Pleasant Grove City v. Summum</i></inline>, the Court shifted from an exclusive focus on the “<quotedText>effective control</quotedText>” test in holding that “<quotedText>permanent monuments displayed on public property,</quotedText>” even when provided by private parties, generally “<quotedText>represent government speech.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857880960"/>In so concluding, the Court relied not only on the fact that a government, in selecting monuments for display in a park, generally exercises “<quotedText>effective control</quotedText>” and has “<quotedText>final approval authority</quotedText>” over the monument, but also on (1) the government’s long history of “<quotedText>us[ing] monuments to speak for the public</quotedText>”; and (2) the public’s common understanding as to monuments and their role in conveying a message from the government.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857876016"/>In <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans</i></inline>, the Court relied on the same analysis used in <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Pleasant Grove City</i></inline> to conclude that the State of Texas, in approving privately crafted designs for specialty license plates, could reject designs the state found offensive without running afoul of the Free Speech Clause.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857871104"/>Specifically, the <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Walker</i></inline> Court held that license plate designs amounted to government speech because (1) states historically used license plates to convey government messages; (2) the public closely identifies license plate designs with the state; and (3) the State of Texas maintained effective control over the messages conveyed on its specialty license plates.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857866400"/></p>
              <p>More recently, in <inline role="name" class="case">Matal v. Tam</inline>, the Supreme Court held that trademarks do not constitute government speech, concluding that it is “far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857863440"/> The Court distinguished trademarks from the license plates at issue in <inline role="name" class="case">Walker</inline>, a case the Court stated “likely marks the outer bounds of the government-speech doctrine.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857861680"/> First, the Court noted that, unlike license plates, trademarks do not have a history of use to convey messages by the government<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857860368"/>. Second, the Court further reasoned that the government does not maintain direct control over the messages conveyed in trademarks—indeed, “[t]he Federal Government does not dream up these marks, and it does not edit marks submitted for registration.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857858928"/> And third, the public, according to the <inline role="name" class="case">Tam</inline> Court, does not closely identify trademarks with the government.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857857072"/> Thus, while <inline role="name" class="case">Tam</inline> demonstrates the Court’s continuing reliance on the multi-factor test for determining government speech from <i>Walker and Summum</i>, that test is not so flexible as to allow for expression like trademarks to be deemed the speech of the government.</p>

              <heading>Commercial Speech</heading>

The conclusion that a communication proposing a commercial transaction is a different order of speech underserving of First Amendment protection was arrived at almost casually in 1942 in <inline role="name" class="case">Valentine v. Chrestensen</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080003"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Chrestensen</inline>, the Court upheld a city ordinance prohibiting distribution on the street of “<quotedText>commercial and business advertising matter,</quotedText>” as applied to an exhibitor of a submarine who distributed leaflets describing his submarine on one side and on the other side protesting the city’s refusal of certain docking facilities. The doctrine was in any event limited to promotion of commercial activities; the fact that expression was disseminated for profit or through commercial channels did not expose it to any greater regulation than if it were offered for free.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080007"/> The doctrine lasted in this form for more than twenty years.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51857845968"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857845552"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871322160"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857849392"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857841136"/>The Court later modified this position so that commercial speech is protected “<quotedText>from unwarranted governmental regulation,</quotedText>” although its nature makes it subject to greater limitations than may be imposed on expression not solely related to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080011"/>The change to its earlier holdings was accomplished within a brief span of time in which the Justices haltingly but then decisively moved to a new position.<marker role="index" misc="idm51871284640"/>Applying the doctrine in a narrow five-to-four decision, the Court sustained the application of a city’s ban on employment discrimination to bar sex-designated employment advertising in a newspaper.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080015"/> Suggesting that speech does not lose its constitutional protection simply because it appears in a commercial context, Justice Powell, for the Court, did find the placing of want-ads in newspapers to be “<quotedText>classic examples of commercial speech,</quotedText>” devoid of expressions of opinions with respect to issues of social policy; so the “<quotedText>did no more than propose a commercial transaction.</quotedText>” But the Justice also noted that employment discrimination, which was facilitated by the advertisements, was itself illegal.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080019"/></p>

The Court held the statute unconstitutional as applied to an editor of a weekly newspaper who published an advertisement announcing the availability of legal and safe abortions in another state and detailing the assistance that would be provided state residents in obtaining abortions in the other state.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080023"/>The Court discerned that the advertisements conveyed information of other than a purely commercial nature, that they related to services that were legal in the other jurisdiction, and that the state could not prevent its residents from obtaining abortions in the other state or punish them for doing so.<marker role="index" misc="idm51857787856"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871284640"/></p>

Consumers’ interests in receiving factual information about prices may even be of greater value than political debate, but in any event price competition and access to information about it is in the public interest. State interests asserted in support of the ban – protection of professionalism and the quality of prescription goods – were found either badly served or not served by the statute.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080031"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857770640"/></p>

The Court voided a municipal ordinance that barred the display of “<quotedText>For sale</quotedText>” and “<quotedText>Sold</quotedText>” signs on residential lawns, purportedly so as to limit “<quotedText>white flight</quotedText>” resulting from a “<quotedText>fear psychology</quotedText>” that developed among white residents following sale of homes to nonwhites. The right of owners to communicate their intention to sell a commodity and the right of potential buyers to receive the message was protected, the Court determined; the community interest could have been achieved by less restrictive means and in any event may not be achieved by restricting the free flow of truthful information.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080035"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857747200"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857745888"/>Similarly, deciding a question it had reserved in the <inline role="name" class="case">Virginia Pharmacy</inline> case, the Court held that a state could not forbid lawyers from advertising the prices they charged for the performance of routine legal services.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080039"/> None of the proffered state justifications for the ban was deemed sufficient to overcome the private and societal interest in the free exchange of this form of speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080043"/> Nor may a state categorically prohibit attorney advertising through mailings that target persons known to face particular legal problems,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080047"/> or prohibit an attorney from holding himself out as a certified civil trial specialist,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080051"/> or prohibit a certified public accountant from holding herself out as a certified financial planner.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080055"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857747200"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857745888"/></p>
              <p>More recently, the Court has distinguished between laws that regulate the conduct of sellers versus those that regulate a seller’s speech. In <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman</i></inline>, the Court held that a New York State statute that prohibits businesses from displaying a cash price alongside a surcharge for credit card purchases burdens speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857708080"/> Relying on Supreme Court precedent suggesting that “price regulation alone regulates conduct, not speech,” the lower court held that the statute was constitutional.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857706896"/> The Supreme Court disagreed, stating “[w]hat the law does regulate is how sellers may communicate their prices,” and “[i]n regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves, [the statute] regulates speech.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857705360"/> The Court, however, remanded the case to the lower court to determine in the first instance whether the law survives First Amendment scrutiny.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857704208"/></p>

              <p>For instance, in <inline role="name" class="case">Sorrell v.

Because the restrictions only applied to the use of this information for marketing and because they principally applied to pharmaceutical manufacturers of non-generic drugs, the Court found that these restrictions were content-based and speaker-based limits and thus subject to heightened scrutiny.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857383504"/></p>

The first prong of the <inline role="name" class="case">Central Hudson</inline> test means that false, deceptive, or misleading advertisements need not be permitted; government may require that a commercial message appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent deception.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080159"/> But even truthful, non-misleading commercial speech may be regulated, and the validity of such regulation is tested by application of the remaining prongs of the <inline role="name" class="case">Central Hudson</inline> test. The test itself does not make further distinctions based on the content of the commercial message or the nature of the governmental interest (that interest need only be “<quotedText>substantial</quotedText>”). Recent decisions suggest, however, that further distinctions may exist. Measures aimed at preserving “<quotedText>a fair bargaining process</quotedText>”between consumer and advertiser<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080163"/> may be more likely to pass the test<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080167"/> than are regulations designed to implement general health, safety, or moral concerns.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080171"/> As the governmental interest becomes further removed from protecting a fair bargaining process, it may become more difficult to establish the absence of less burdensome regulatory alternatives and the presence of a “<quotedText>reasonable fit</quotedText>” between the commercial speech restriction and the governmental interest.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080175"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857845968"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857845552"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857849392"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857841136"/></p>

This is so, the Court explained in 1983, because such “<quotedText>a powerful weapon</quotedText>” to single out a small group carries with it a lessened political constraint than do those measures affecting a broader based constituency, and because “<quotedText>differential treatment, unless justified by some special characteristic of the press, suggests that the goal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of expression.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080199"/> The state’s interest in raising revenue is not sufficient justification for differential treatment of the press. Moreover, the Court refused to adopt a rule permitting analysis of the “<quotedText>effective burden</quotedText>” imposed by a differential tax; even if the current effective tax burden could be measured and upheld, the threat of increasing the burden on the press might have “<quotedText>censorial effects,</quotedText>” and “<quotedText>courts as institutions are poorly equipped to evaluate with precision the relative burdens of various methods of taxation.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080203"/></p>

An Arkansas sales tax exemption for newspapers and for “<quotedText>religious, professional, trade, and sports journals</quotedText>”published within the state was struck down as an invalid content-based regulation of the press.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080207"/> Entirely as a result of content, some magazines were treated less favorably than others. The general interest in raising revenue was again rejected as a “<quotedText>compelling</quotedText>” justification for such treatment, and the measure was viewed as not narrowly tailored to achieve other asserted state interests in encouraging “<quotedText>fledgling</quotedText>” publishers and in fostering communications.</p>

The statute applied only to income derived from speech, not to income from other sources, and it was significantly overinclusive because it reached a wide range of literature (<i>e.g.</i>, the <i>Confessions of Saint Augustine</i> and Thoreau’s <i>Civil Disobedience</i>) “<quotedText>that did not enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080219"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857305552"/></p>

The First Amendment, far from providing an argument against application of the Sherman Act, here provides powerful reasons to the contrary. That Amendment rests on the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public, that a free press is a condition of a free society. Surely a command that the government itself shall not impede the free flow of ideas does not afford non-governmental combinations a refuge if they impose restraints upon that constitutionally guaranteed freedom.

FCC</inline>, the Court upheld an FCC regulation that required broadcasters to afford persons an opportunity to reply if they were attacked on the air on the basis of their “<quotedText>honesty, character, integrity or like personal qualities,</quotedText>” or if they were legally qualified candidates and a broadcast editorial endorsed their opponent or opposed them.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080255"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Red Lion</inline>, Justice White explained that “<quotedText>differences in the characteristics of [various] media justify differences in First Amendment standards applied to them.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080259"/> Thus, although everyone has a right to speak, write, or publish as he will, subject to very few limitations, there is no comparable right of everyone to broadcast. The frequencies are limited and some few must be given the privilege over others. The particular licensee, however, has no First Amendment right to hold that license and his exclusive privilege may be qualified. Qualification by censorship of content is impermissible, but the First Amendment does not prevent a governmental insistence that a licensee “<quotedText>conduct himself as a proxy or fiduciary with obligations to present those views and voices which are representative of his community and which would otherwise, by necessity, be barred from the airwaves.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857091744"/> Furthermore, said Justice White, “<quotedText>[b]ecause of the scarcity of radio frequencies, the government is permitted to put restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on this unique medium. But the people as a whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their collective right to have the medium function consistently with the ends and purposes of the First Amendment. It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080263"/> The broadcasters had argued that, if they were required to provide equal time at their expense to persons attacked and to points of view different from those expressed on the air, expression would be curbed through self-censorship, for fear of controversy and economic loss. Justice White thought this possibility “<quotedText>at best speculative,</quotedText>” but if it should materialize “<quotedText>the Commission is not powerless to insist that they give adequate and fair attention to public issues.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080267"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857101648"/></p>

Democratic National Committee</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080271"/>the Court rejected claims of political groups that the broadcast networks were constitutionally required to sell them broadcasting time for the presentation of views on controversial issues. The ruling terminated a broad drive to obtain that result, but the fragmented nature of the Court’s multiple opinions precluded a satisfactory evaluation of the constitutional implications of the case. However, in <inline role="name" class="case">CBS v. FCC</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080275"/> the Court held that Congress had conferred on candidates seeking federal elective office an affirmative, promptly enforceable right of reasonable access to the use of broadcast stations, to be administered through FCC control over license revocations, and held such right of access to be within Congress’s power to grant, the First Amendment notwithstanding. The constitutional analysis was brief and merely restated the spectrum scarcity rationale and the role of the broadcasters as fiduciaries for the public interest.<marker role="index" misc="idm51857110624"/></p>

League of Women Voters</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080279"/> the Court took the same general approach to governmental regulation of broadcasting, but struck down a total ban on editorializing by stations receiving public funding. In summarizing the principles guiding analysis in this area, the Court reaffirmed that Congress may regulate in ways that would be impermissible in other contexts, but indicated that broadcasters are entitled to greater protection than may have been suggested by <inline role="name" class="case">Red Lion</inline>. “<quotedText>[A]lthough the broadcasting industry plainly operates under restraints not imposed upon other media, the thrust of these restrictions has generally been to secure the public’s First Amendment interest in receiving a balanced presentation of views on diverse matters of public concern. . . . [T]hese restrictions have been upheld only when we were satisfied that the restriction is narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080283"/>However, the earlier cases were distinguished. “<quotedText>[I]n sharp contrast to the restrictions upheld in <inline role="name" class="case">Red Lion</inline> or in [<inline role="name" class="case">CBS v. FCC</inline>], which left room for editorial discretion and simply required broadcast editors to grant others access to the microphone, § 399 directly prohibits the broadcaster from speaking out on public issues even in a balanced and fair manner.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080287"/> The ban on all editorializing was deemed too severe and restrictive a means of accomplishing the governmental purposes – protecting public broadcasting stations from being coerced, through threat or fear of withdrawal of public funding, into becoming “<quotedText>vehicles for governmental propagandizing,</quotedText>” and also keeping the stations “<quotedText>from becoming convenient targets for capture by private interest groups wishing to express their own partisan viewpoints.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080291"/> Expression of editorial opinion was described as a “<quotedText>form of speech . . . that lies at the heart of First Amendment protection,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080295"/> and the ban was said to be “<quotedText>defined solely on the basis of . . . content,</quotedText>” the assumption being that editorial speech is speech directed at “<quotedText>controversial issues of public importance.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080299"/> Moreover, the ban on editorializing was both overinclusive, applying to commentary on local issues of no likely interest to Congress, and underinclusive, not applying at all to expression of controversial opinion in the context of regular programming. Therefore, the Court concluded, the restriction was not narrowly enough tailored to fulfill the government’s purposes.<marker role="index" misc="idm51857142864"/></p>

Patently offensive, indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizens, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual’s right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder. . . . Second, broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read. . . . The ease with which children may obtain access to broadcast material . . . amply justif[ies] special treatment of indecent broadcasting.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080307"/> The Court emphasized the “<quotedText>narrowness</quotedText>” of its holding, which “<quotedText>requires consideration of a host of variables.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080311"/> The use of more than “<quotedText>an occasional expletive,</quotedText>” the time of day of the broadcast, the likely audience, “<quotedText>and differences between radio, television, and perhaps closed-circuit transmissions</quotedText>” were all relevant in the Court’s view.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51857011008"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857146880"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857138736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857029520"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857141040"/></p>

First Amendment jurisprudence</quotedText>” govern review of cable regulation; cable is not limited by “<quotedText>scarce</quotedText>” broadcast frequencies and does not require the same less rigorous standard of review that the Court applies to regulation of broadcasting.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080331"/> Cable does, however, have unique characteristics that justify regulations that single out cable for special treatment.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080335"/> The Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080339"/> upheld federal statutory requirements that cable systems carry local commercial and public television stations. Although these “<quotedText>must-carry</quotedText>” requirements “<quotedText>distinguish between speakers in the television programming market,</quotedText>” they do so based on the manner of transmission and not on the content the messages conveyed, and hence are content-neutral.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080343"/> The regulations could therefore be measured by the “<quotedText>intermediate level of scrutiny</quotedText>” set forth in <inline role="name" class="case">United States v. O’Brien</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080347"/> Two years later, however, a splintered Court could not agree on what standard of review to apply to content-based restrictions of cable broadcasts. Striking down a requirement that cable operators must, in order to protect children, segregate and block programs with patently offensive sexual material, a Court majority in <inline role="name" class="case">Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. FCC</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080351"/> found it unnecessary to determine whether strict scrutiny or some lesser standard applies, because it deemed the restriction invalid under any of the alternative tests. There was no opinion of the Court on the other two holdings in the case,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080355"/> and a plurality<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080359"/> rejected assertions that public forum analysis,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080363"/> or a rule giving cable operators’ editorial rights “<quotedText>general primacy</quotedText>” over the rights of programmers and viewers,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080367"/> should govern.</p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51857138736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857146016"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871322160"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857139712"/>Subsequently, in <inline role="name" class="case">United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856906528"/> the Supreme Court made clear, as it had not in <inline role="name" class="case">Denver Consortium</inline>, that strict scrutiny applies to content-based speech restrictions on cable television. The Court struck down a federal statute designed to “<quotedText>shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed,</quotedText>” which refers to blurred images or sounds that come through to non-subscribers.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856903376"/> The statute required cable operators, on channels primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming, either to scramble fully or otherwise fully block such channels, or to not provide such programming when a significant number of children are likely to be viewing it, which, under an FCC regulation meant to transmit the programming only from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The Court found that, even without “<quotedText>discount[ing] the possibility that a graphic image could have a negative impact on a young child,</quotedText>” it could not conclude that Congress had used “<quotedText>the least restrictive means for addressing the problem.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856900544"/> Congress in fact had enacted another provision that was less restrictive and that served the government’s purpose. This other provision requires that, upon request by a cable subscriber, a cable operator, without charge, fully scramble or otherwise fully block any channel to which a subscriber does not subscribe.<marker role="index" misc="idm51857138736"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857146016"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871322160"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51857139712"/><ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856892272"/></p>

            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51856890624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/>As a general matter, government may not regulate speech “<quotedText>because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080375"/>“<quotedText>It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856871728"/>The constitutionality of content-based regulation is determined by a compelling interest test derived from equal protection analysis: the government “<quotedText>must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856860832"/>Narrow tailoring in the case of fully protected speech requires that the government “<quotedText>choose[ ] the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856858208"/> Application of this test ordinarily results in invalidation of the regulation.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856855904"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51856890624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/>The Court has recognized two central ways in which a law can impose content-based restrictions, which include not only restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also prohibitions on public discussions of an entire topic.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856848224"/> First, a government regulation of speech is content-based if the regulation on its face draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856843472"/> For example, in <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Boos v. Barry</i></inline>, the Court held that a Washington D.C. ordinance prohibiting the display of signs near any foreign embassy that brought a foreign government into “<quotedText>public odiom</quotedText>” or “<quotedText>public disrepute</quotedText>” drew a content-based distinction on its face.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856836528"/>Second, the Court has recognized that facially content-neutral laws can be considered content-based regulations of speech if a law cannot be “<quotedText>justified without reference to the content of speech</quotedText>” or was adopted “<quotedText>because of disagreement with the message [the speech] conveys.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856833920"/> As a result, in an example provided in <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Sorrell v. IMS Health</i></inline>, the Court noted that if a government “<quotedText>bent on frustrating an impending demonstration</quotedText>” passed a law demanding two years’ notice before the issuance of parade permits, such a law, while facially content-neutral, would be content-based because its purpose was to suppress speech on a particular topic.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856828448"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51856890624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/>Importantly, for a law that falls within the first category of recognized content-based regulations—those laws that are content-based on their face—the government’s justifications or purposes for enacting that law are irrelevant to determine whether the law is subject to strict scrutiny.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856823472"/> Put another way, for laws that facially draw distinctions based on the subject matter of the underlying speech, there is no need for a court to look into the purpose of the underlying law being challenged under the First Amendment; instead, that law is automatically subject to strict scrutiny.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856820096"/> As such, in <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Reed v. Town of Gilbert</i></inline>, the Court, in invalidating provisions of a municipality’s sign code that imposed more stringent restrictions on signs directing the public to an event than on signs conveying political or ideological messages, determined the sign code to be content-based and subject to strict scrutiny, notwithstanding the town’s “<quotedText>benign,</quotedText>” non-speech related motives for enacting the code.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856812240"/> In so holding, the Court reasoned that the First Amendment, by targeting the “<quotedText>abridgement of speech,</quotedText>” is centrally concerned with the operations of laws and not the motivations of those who enacted the laws.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856807632"/> In this vein, the Court concluded that the “<quotedText>vice</quotedText>” of content-based legislation is not that it will “<quotedText>always</quotedText>” be used for invidious purposes, but rather that content-based restrictions necessarily lend themselves to such purposes.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856805664"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51856890624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/>Nonetheless, as discussed below, the Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment permits restrictions upon the content of speech in a “<quotedText>few limited areas,</quotedText>” including obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, fighting words, and speech integral to criminal conduct.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856801200"/> This “<quotedText>two-tier</quotedText>” approach to content-based regulations of speech derives from <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</i></inline>, wherein the Court opined that there exist “<quotedText>certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech [that] are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth</quotedText>” such that the government may prevent those utterances and punish those uttering them without raising any constitutional issues.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856795312"/> As the Court has generally applied <inline role="name" class="case"><i>Chaplinsky</i></inline> over the past several decades, if speech fell within one of the “<quotedText>well-defined and narrowly limited</quotedText>” categories, it was unprotected, regardless of its effect. If it did not, it was covered by the First Amendment, and the speech was protected unless the restraint was justified by some test relating to harm, such as the clear and present danger test or the more modern approach of balancing the presumptively protected expression against a compelling governmental interest. In more recent decades, the cases reflect a fairly consistent and sustained movement by the Court toward eliminating or severely narrowing the “<quotedText>two-tier</quotedText>” doctrine. As a result, expression that before would have been held absolutely <i>unprotected</i> (e.g., seditious speech and seditious libel, fighting words, defamation, and obscenity) received protection. While the movement was temporarily deflected by a shift in position with respect to obscenity and by the recognition of a new category of non-obscene child pornography,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856790864"/>the most recent decisions of the Court reflect a reluctance to add any new categories of excepted speech and to interpret narrowly the excepted categories of speech that have long-established roots in First Amendment law.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856788112"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51856890624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/>Even if a category of speech is <i>unprotected</i> by the First Amendment, regulation of that speech on the basis of viewpoint may be <i>impermissible</i>. In <inline role="name" class="case"><i>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul</i></inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856770144"/>the Court struck down a hate crimes ordinance that the state courts had construed to apply only to the use of “<quotedText>fighting words.</quotedText>” The difficulty, the Court found, was that the ordinance discriminated further, proscribing only those fighting words that “<quotedText>arouse[ ] anger, alarm or resentment in others . . . on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856768000"/>This amounted to “<quotedText>special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856766592"/>The fact that the government may proscribe areas of speech such as obscenity, defamation, or fighting words does not mean that these areas “<quotedText>may be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their distinctively proscribable content. Thus, the government may proscribe libel; but it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing <i>only</i> libel critical of the government.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856764272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51856890624"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51860074400"/></p>

The defendant had been convicted under this statute after he had distributed a leaflet, part of which was in the form of a petition to his city government, taking a hard-line white-supremacy position, and calling for action to keep African Americans out of white neighborhoods. Justice Frankfurter for the Court sustained the statute along the following reasoning. Libel of an individual, he established, was a common-law crime and was now made criminal by statute in every state in the Union. These laws raise no constitutional difficulty because libel is within that class of speech that is not protected by the First Amendment. If an utterance directed at an individual may be the object of criminal sanctions, then no good reason appears to deny a state the power to punish the same utterances when they are directed at a defined group, “<quotedText>unless we can say that this is a willful and purposeless restriction unrelated to the peace and well-being of the State.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080531"/> The Justice then reviewed the history of racial strife in Illinois to conclude that the legislature could reasonably have feared substantial evils from unrestrained racial utterances. Nor did the Constitution require the state to accept a defense of truth, because historically a defendant had to show not only truth but publication with good motives and for justifiable ends.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080535"/>“<quotedText>Libelous utterances not being within the area of constitutionally protected speech, it is unnecessary . . . to consider the issues behind the phrase ‘clear and present danger.’</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080539"/></p>

The plaintiff, a city commissioner in charge of the police department, claimed that the advertisement had libeled him even though he was not referred to by name or title and even though several of the incidents described had occurred prior to his assumption of office. Unanimously, the Court reversed the lower court’s judgment for the plaintiff. To the contention that the First Amendment did not protect libelous publications, the Court replied that constitutional scrutiny could not be foreclosed by the “<quotedText>label</quotedText>” attached to something. “<quotedText>Like . . . the various other formulae for the repression of expression that have been challenged in this Court, libel can claim no talismanic immunity from constitutional limitations.

Criticism of government is at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free discussion. Criticism of those responsible for government operations must be free, lest criticism of government itself be penalized.

First, the Court created a subcategory of “<quotedText>public figure,</quotedText>” which included those otherwise private individuals who have attained some prominence, either through their own efforts or because it was thrust upon them, with respect to a matter of public interest, or, in Chief Justice Warren’s words, those persons who are “<quotedText>intimately involved in the resolution of important public questions or, by reason of their fame, shape events in areas of concern to society at large.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080623"/> Later, the Court curtailed the definition of “<quotedText>public figure</quotedText>” by playing down the matter of public interest and emphasizing the voluntariness of the assumption of a role in public affairs that will make of one a “<quotedText>public figure.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080627"/></p>

Robert Welch, Inc.</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080635"/> the Court set off on a new path of limiting recovery for defamation by private persons. Henceforth, persons who are neither public officials nor public figures may recover for the publication of defamatory falsehoods so long as state defamation law establishes a standard higher than strict liability, such as negligence; damages may not be presumed, however, but must be proved, and punitive damages will be recoverable only upon the <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> showing of “<quotedText>actual malice.</quotedText>”</p>

On the one hand, imposition upon the press of liability for every misstatement would deter not only false speech but much truth as well; the possibility that the press might have to prove everything it prints would lead to self-censorship and the consequent deprivation of the public of access to information. On the other hand, there is a legitimate state interest in compensating individuals for the harm inflicted on them by defamatory falsehoods. An individual’s right to the protection of his own good name is, at bottom, but a reflection of our society’s concept of the worth of the individual. Therefore, an accommodation must be reached. The <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> rule had been a proper accommodation when public officials or public figures were concerned, inasmuch as by their own efforts they had brought themselves into the public eye, had created a need in the public for information about them, and had at the same time attained an ability to counter defamatory falsehoods published about them. Private individuals are not in the same position and need greater protection. “<quotedText>We hold that, so long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080639"/> Thus, some degree of fault must be shown.</p>

But this discretion of juries had the potential to inhibit the exercise of freedom of the press, and moreover permitted juries to penalize unpopular opinion through the awarding of damages. Therefore, defamation plaintiffs who do not prove actual malice – that is, knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth – will be limited to compensation for actual provable injuries, such as out-of-pocket loss, impairment of reputation and standing, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering. A plaintiff who proves actual malice will be entitled as well to collect punitive damages.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080643"/></p>

A socially prominent litigant in a particularly messy divorce controversy was held not to be such a person,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080647"/> and a person convicted years before of contempt after failing to appear before a grand jury was similarly not a public figure even as to commentary with respect to his conviction.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080651"/> Also not a public figure for purposes of allegedly defamatory comment about the value of his research was a scientist who sought and received federal grants for research, the results of which were published in scientific journals.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080655"/> Public figures, the Court reiterated, are those who (1) occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes or (2) have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved, and are public figures with respect to comment on those issues.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080659"/></p>

First, when a private plaintiff sues a media defendant for publication of information that is a matter of public concern – the <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> situation, in other words – the burden is on the plaintiff to establish the falsity of the information. Thus, the Court held in <inline role="name" class="case">Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080667"/> the common law rule that defamatory statements are presumptively false must give way to the First Amendment interest that true speech on matters of public concern not be inhibited. This means, as the dissenters pointed out, that a <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> plaintiff must establish falsity in addition to establishing some degree of fault (<i>e.g.</i>, negligence).<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080671"/> On the other hand, the Court held in<inline role="name" class="case">Dun &amp; Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders</inline> that the <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> standard limiting award of presumed and punitive damages applies only in cases involving matters of public concern, and that the sale of credit reporting information to subscribers is not such a matter of public concern.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080675"/> What significance, if any, is to be attributed to the fact that a media defendant rather than a private defendant has been sued is left unclear. The plurality in <inline role="name" class="case">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</inline> declined to follow the lower court’s rationale that <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> protections are unavailable to nonmedia defendants, and a majority of Justices agreed on that point.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080679"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Philadelphia Newspapers</inline>, however, the Court expressly reserved the issue of “<quotedText>what standards would apply if the plaintiff sues a nonmedia defendant.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080683"/></p>

The use of the expression “<quotedText>actual malice</quotedText>” has been confusing in many respects, because it is in fact a concept distinct from the common law meaning of malice or the meanings common understanding might give to it.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080687"/>Constitutional “<quotedText>actual malice</quotedText>” means that the defamation was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080691"/> Reckless disregard is not simply negligent behavior, but publication with serious doubts as to the truth of what is uttered.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080695"/> A defamation plaintiff under the <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> or <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline>standard has the burden of proving by “<quotedText>clear and convincing</quotedText>”evidence, not merely by the preponderance of evidence standard ordinarily borne in civil cases, that the defendant acted with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080699"/>Moreover, the Court has held, a <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> plaintiff has the burden of proving the actual falsity of the defamatory publication.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080703"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855976992"/> A plaintiff suing the press<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080707"/> for defamation under the <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> or <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> standards is not limited to attempting to prove his case without resort to discovery of the defendant’s editorial processes in the establishment of “<quotedText>actual malice.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080711"/> The state of mind of the defendant may be inquired into and the thoughts, opinions, and conclusions with respect to the material gathered and its review and handling are proper subjects of discovery. <marker role="index" misc="idm51855976992"/>As with other areas of protection or qualified protection under the First Amendment (as well as some other constitutional provisions), appellate courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, must independently review the findings below to ascertain that constitutional standards were met.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080715"/></p>

Thus, if statements of opinion may “<quotedText>reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080731"/> then the truthfulness of the factual assertions may be tested in a defamation action. There are sufficient protections for free public discourse already available in defamation law, the Court concluded, without creating “<quotedText>an artificial dichotomy between ‘opinion’ and fact.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080735"/></p>

For instance, more than 100 federal criminal statutes punish false statements in areas of concern to federal courts or agencies,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855898064"/> and the Court has often noted the limited First Amendment value of such speech.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855894912"/> The Court, however, has declined to find that all false statements fall outside of First Amendment protection. In <inline role="name" class="case">United States v.

Justice Breyer, in a separate opinion joined by Justice Kagan, concurred in judgment, but did so only after evaluating the prohibition under an intermediate scrutiny standard. While Justice Breyer was also concerned about the breadth of the act, his opinion went on to suggest that a similar statute, more finely tailored to situations where a specific harm is likely to occur, could withstand legal challenge.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855879056"/></p>

Hill</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080759"/> the <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> privilege was held to preclude recovery under a state privacy statute that permitted recovery for harm caused by exposure to public attention in any publication which contained factual inaccuracies, although not necessarily defamatory inaccuracies, in communications on matters of public interest. Since <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz </inline>held that the <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> privilege did not limit the recovery of compensatory damages for defamation by private persons, the question arose whether <inline role="name" class="case">Hill</inline> applies to all “<quotedText>false-light</quotedText>” cases or only such cases involving public officials or public figures.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080767"/> And, more important, <inline role="name" class="case">Gertz</inline> left unresolved the issue “<quotedText>whether the State may ever define and protect an area of privacy free from unwanted publicity in the press.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080771"/></p>

Thus, the state could not permit a civil recovery for invasion of privacy occasioned by the reporting of the name of a rape victim obtained from court records and from a proceeding in open court.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080775"/> Nevertheless, the Court in appearing to retreat from what had seemed to be settled principle, that truth is a constitutionally required defense in any defamation action, whether plaintiff be a public official, public figure, or private individual, may have preserved for itself the discretion to recognize a constitutionally permissible tort of invasion of privacy through publication of truthful information.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080779"/> But in recognition of the conflicting interests – in expression and in privacy – it is evident that the judicial process in this area will be cautious.</p>

Falwell</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080787"/> the Court applied the <inline role="name" class="case">New York Times v. Sullivan</inline>standard to recovery of damages by public officials and public figures for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case involved an advertisement “<quotedText>parody</quotedText>” portraying the plaintiff, described by the Court as a “<quotedText>nationally known minister who has been active as a commentator on politics and public affairs,</quotedText>” as stating that he lost his virginity “<quotedText>during a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080791"/> Affirming liability in this case, the Court believed, would subject “<quotedText>political cartoonists and satirists . . . to damage awards without any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080795"/>A proffered “<quotedText>outrageousness</quotedText>” standard for distinguishing such parodies from more traditional political cartoons was rejected; although not doubting that “<quotedText>the caricature of respondent . . . is at best a distant cousin of [some] political cartoons . . . and a rather poor relation at that,</quotedText>” the Court explained that “<quotedText>‘[o]utrageousness’ in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors’ tastes or views. . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080799"/> Therefore, proof of intent to cause injury, “<quotedText>the gravamen of the tort,</quotedText>” is insufficient “<quotedText>in the area of public debate about public figures.</quotedText>” Additional proof that the publication contained a false statement of fact made with actual malice was necessary, the Court concluded, in order “<quotedText>to give adequate ‘breathing space’ to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080803"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855777248"/></p>
              <p>The Court next considered whether an intentional infliction of emotional distress action could be brought by a father against public protestors who picketed the military funeral of his son, where the plaintiff was neither a public official nor a public figure. Based on the reasoning of <inline role="name" class="case">Hustler Magazine</inline>, one might presume that the <inline role="name" class="case">Times</inline> privilege would not extend to the intentional infliction of emotional distress upon a private citizen. However, in<inline role="name" class="case">Snyder v. Phelps</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855755328"/> the Court avoided addressing this issue, finding that where public protesters are addressing issues of public concern, the fact that such protests occurred in a setting likely to upset private individuals did not reduce the First Amendment protection of that speech. In <inline role="name" class="case">Phelps</inline>, the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church, based on the belief that God punishes the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in America’s armed forces, had engaged in nearly 600 protests at funerals, mostly military. While it was admitted that the plaintiff had suffered emotional distress after a protest at his son's funeral, the Court declined to characterize the protests as directed at the father personally.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855751776"/> Rather, considering the “<quotedText>content, form, and context</quotedText>” of that speech,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855745968"/> the Court found that the dominant themes of the protest went to public concerns, and thus could not serve as the basis for a tort suit.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855744672"/></p>

The Court emphasized two differences between the legal action permitted here and the legal actions found unprotected or not fully protected in defamation and other privacy-type suits. First, the interest sought to be protected was, rather than a party’s right to his reputation and freedom from mental distress, the right of the performer to remuneration for putting on his act. Second, the other torts if permitted decreased the information that would be made available to the public, whereas permitting this tort action would have an impact only on “<quotedText>who gets to do the publishing.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080811"/> In both respects, the tort action was analogous to patent and copyright laws in that both provide an economic incentive to persons to make the investment required to produce a performance of interest to the public.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080815"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855739648"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855736976"/></p>

For publishing an accurate report about an investigation of a sitting judge, the newspaper was indicted and convicted of violating the statute, which the state courts construed to apply to nonparticipants. Although the Court recognized the importance of confidentiality to the effectiveness of such a proceeding, it held that the publication here “<quotedText>lies near the core of the First Amendment</quotedText>” because the free discussion of public affairs, including the operation of the judicial system, is primary and the state’s interests were simply insufficient to justify the encroachment on freedom of speech and of the press.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080823"/> The scope of the privilege thus conferred by this decision on the press and on individuals is, however, somewhat unclear, because the Court appeared to reserve consideration of broader questions than those presented by the facts of the case.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080827"/> It does appear, however, that government would find it difficult to punish the publication of almost any information by a nonparticipant to the process in which the information was developed to the same degree as it would be foreclosed from obtaining prior restraint of such publication.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080831"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871284640"/> There are also limits on the extent to which government may punish disclosures by <i>participants</i> in the criminal process, the Court having invalidated a restriction on a grand jury witness’s disclosure of his own testimony after the grand jury had been discharged.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080835"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855721840"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855719104"/></p>

It was this history that had caused the Court in <inline role="name" class="case">Beauharnais</inline> to conclude that “<quotedText>libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,</quotedText>” and this history was deemed to demonstrate that “<quotedText>obscenity, too, was outside the protection intended for speech and press.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080024"/>“<quotedText>The protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people . . . . All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance – unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion – have the full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests. But implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080028"/> It was objected that obscenity legislation punishes because of incitation to impure thoughts and without proof that obscene materials create a clear and present danger of antisocial conduct.

The portrayal of sex, <i>e.g.</i>, in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press . . . . It is therefore vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard the protection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080036"/> The standard that the Court thereupon adopted for the designation of material as unprotected obscenity was “<quotedText>whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080040"/> The Court defined material appealing to prurient interest as “<quotedText>material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts,</quotedText>” and defined prurient interest as “<quotedText>a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080044"/></p>

The same five-Justice majority, with Justice Harlan concurring, the same day affirmed a state conviction of a distributor of books addressed to a sado-masochistic audience, applying the “<quotedText>pandering</quotedText>” test and concluding that material could be held legally obscene if it appealed to the prurient interests of the deviate group to which it was directed.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080076"/> Unanimity was shattered, however, when on the same day the Court held that<i>Fanny Hill</i>, a novel at that point 277 years old, was not legally obscene.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080080"/> The prevailing opinion again restated the <inline role="name" class="case">Roth</inline> tests that, to be considered obscene, material must (1) have a dominant theme in the work considered as a whole that appeals to prurient interest, (2) be patently offensive because it goes beyond contemporary community standards, and (3) be utterly without redeeming social value.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080084"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871062016"/></p>

The initial case was <inline role="name" class="case">Redrup v.

It does not matter that the states may be acting on the basis of unverifiable assumptions in arriving at the decision to suppress the trade in pornography; the Constitution does not require in the context of the trade in ideas that governmental courses of action be subject to empirical verification any more than it does in other fields. Nor does the Constitution embody any concept of laissez faire, or of privacy, or of Millsean “<quotedText>free will,</quotedText>” that curbs governmental efforts to suppress pornography.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080116"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855587984"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51859554864"/></p>

Because of the inherent dangers in undertaking to regulate any form of expression, laws to regulate pornography must be carefully limited; their scope is to be confined to materials that “<quotedText>depict or describe patently offensive ‘hard core’ sexual conduct specifically defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080124"/> The law “<quotedText>must also be limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080128"/> The standard that a work must be “<quotedText>utterly without redeeming social value</quotedText>” before it may be suppressed was disavowed and discarded. In determining whether material appeals to a prurient interest or is patently offensive, the trier of fact, whether a judge or a jury, is not bound by a hypothetical national standard but may apply the local community standard where the trier of fact sits.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080132"/> Prurient interest and patent offensiveness, the Court indicated, “<quotedText>are essentially questions of fact.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080136"/> By contrast, the third or “<quotedText>value</quotedText>” prong of the <inline role="name" class="case">Miller</inline> test is not subject to a community standards test; instead, the appropriate standard is “<quotedText>whether a reasonable person would find [literary, artistic, political, or scientific] value in the material, taken as a whole.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080140"/></p>

(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080144"/> Subsequently, the Court held that a publication was not obscene if it “<quotedText>provoked only normal, healthy sexual desires.</quotedText>” To be obscene it must appeal to “<quotedText>a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51855301600"/> The Court has also indicated that obscenity is not be limited to pictures; books containing only descriptive language may be suppressed.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080148"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Jenkins v.

Georgia</inline> was an appeal from a state conviction for possession of obscene films discovered in appellant’s home by police officers armed with a search warrant for other items which were not found. The Court reversed, holding that the mere private possession of obscene materials in the home cannot be made a criminal offense. The Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas, the Court said, regardless of their social value, and “<quotedText>that right takes on an added dimension</quotedText>” in the context of a prosecution for possession of something in one’s own home. “<quotedText>For also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one’s privacy.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080184"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51855870992"/> Despite the unqualified assertion in <inline role="name" class="case">Roth</inline> that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment, the Court observed, it and the cases following were concerned with the governmental interest in regulating commercial distribution of obscene materials. <i>Roth</i> and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today’s decision, the Court insisted,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080188"/> but in its rejection of each of the state contentions made in support of the conviction the Court appeared to be rejecting much of the basis of <inline role="name" class="case">Roth</inline>. First, there is no governmental interest in protecting an individual’s mind from the effect of obscenity. Second, the absence of ideological content in the films was irrelevant, since the Court will not draw a line between transmission of ideas and entertainment. Third, there is no empirical evidence to support a contention that exposure to obscene materials may incite a person to antisocial conduct; even if there were such evidence, enforcement of laws proscribing the offensive conduct is the answer. Fourth, punishment of mere possession is not necessary to punishment of distribution. Fifth, there was little danger that private possession would give rise to the objections underlying a proscription upon public dissemination, exposure to children and unwilling adults.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080192"/></p>

Ferber</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080212"/> the Court recognized another category of expression that is outside the coverage of the First Amendment: the visual depiction of children in films or still photographs in a variety of sexual activities or exposures of the genitals. The reason that such depictions may be prohibited was the governmental interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of children, whose participation in the production of these materials would subject them to exploitation and harm. The state may go beyond a mere prohibition of the use of children, because it is not possible to protect children adequately without prohibiting the exhibition and dissemination of the materials and advertising about them. Thus, “<quotedText>the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication is required.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080216"/> But, because expression is involved, the government must carefully define what conduct is to be prohibited and may reach only “<quotedText>works that <i>visually</i> depict sexual conduct by children below a specified age.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080220"/></p>

The plurality found that, assuming that government entities have First Amendment rights (it did not decide the question), “<quotedText>CIPA does not ‘penalize’ libraries that choose not to install such software, or deny them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered Internet access.

Whether this represents a distinction between live performances and other entertainment media, or whether it signals a more permissive approach overall to governmental regulation of non-obscene but sexually explicit material, remains to be seen. In <inline role="name" class="case">Barnes v.

There was no opinion of the Court, three Justices viewing the statute as a permissible regulation of “<quotedText>societal order and morality,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080268"/>one viewing it as a permissible means of regulating supposed secondary effects of prostitution and other criminal activity,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080272"/> and a fifth Justice seeing no need for special First Amendment protection from a law of general applicability directed at conduct rather than expression.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080276"/> All but one of the Justices agreed that nude dancing is entitled to some First Amendment protection,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080280"/> but the result of <inline role="name" class="case">Barnes</inline> was a bare minimum of protection. Numerous questions remain unanswered. In addition to the uncertainty over applicability of <inline role="name" class="case">Barnes</inline> to regulation of the content of films or other shows in “<quotedText>adult</quotedText>” theaters,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080284"/> there is also the issue of its applicability to nudity in operas or theatrical productions not normally associated with commercial exploitation of sex.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080288"/> But broad implications for First Amendment doctrine are probably unwarranted.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080292"/> The Indiana statute was not limited in application to barrooms; had it been, then the Twenty-first Amendment would have afforded additional authority to regulate the erotic dancing.</p>

            <heading>Speech Plus – The Constitutional Law of Leafleting, Picketing, and Demonstrating</heading>
            <p>Communication of political, economic, social, and other views is not accomplished solely by face-to-face speech, broadcast speech, or writing in newspapers, periodicals, and pamphlets. There is also “<quotedText>expressive conduct,</quotedText>” which includes picketing and marching, distribution of leaflets and pamphlets, addresses to publicly assembled audiences, door-to-door solicitation, and sit-ins. There is also a class of conduct, now only vaguely defined, that has been denominated “<quotedText>symbolic conduct,</quotedText>” which includes such actions as flag desecration and draft-card burnings. Because all these ways of expressing oneself involve conduct rather than mere speech, they are all much more subject to regulation and restriction than is simple speech. Some of them may be forbidden altogether. But, to the degree that these actions are intended to communicate a point of view, the First Amendment is relevant and protects some of them to a great extent. Sorting out the conflicting lines of principle and doctrine is the point of this section.</p>

First, there is the traditional public forum – places such as streets and parks that have traditionally been used for public assembly and debate, where the government may not prohibit all communicative activity and must justify content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions as narrowly tailored to serve a legitimate interest.<ref class="footnote" idref="Summum"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854704080"/>Second, there is the designated public forum, where the government opens property for communicative activity and thereby creates a public forum. Such a forum may be limited – hence the expression “<quotedText>limited public forum</quotedText>” – for “<quotedText>use by certain groups, <i>e.g.</i>, <inline role="name" class="case">Widmar v. Vincent</inline> (student groups), or for discussion of certain subjects, <i>e.g.</i>, <inline role="name" class="case">City of Madison Joint School District v. Wisconsin PERC</inline> (school board business),</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080416"/> but, within the framework of such legitimate limitations, “<quotedText>a content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080420"/> Third, with respect to “<quotedText>[p]ublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication,</quotedText>” the government “<quotedText>may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as the regulation on [sic] speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker’s view.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080424"/> The distinction between the first and second categories, on the one hand, and third category, on the other, can therefore determine the outcome of a case, because speakers may be excluded from the first and second categories only for a “<quotedText>compelling</quotedText>”governmental interest, whereas exclusion from the third category need only be “<quotedText>reasonable.</quotedText>”</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51854703248"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51859556176"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854701472"/>The Court held that a school system did not create a limited public forum by opening an interschool mail system to use by selected civic groups “<quotedText>that engage in activities of interest and educational relevance to students,</quotedText>” and that, in any event, if a limited public forum had thereby been created a teachers union rivaling the exclusive bargaining representative could still be excluded as not being “<quotedText>of a similar character</quotedText>” to the civic groups.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080428"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51859556176"/> Less problematic was the Court’s conclusion that utility poles and other municipal property did not constitute a public forum for the posting of signs.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080432"/> More problematic was the Court’s conclusion that the Combined Federal Campaign, the Federal Government’s forum for coordinated charitable solicitation of federal employees, is not a limited public forum. Exclusion of various advocacy groups from participation in the Campaign was upheld as furthering “<quotedText>reasonable</quotedText>” governmental interests in offering a forum to “<quotedText>traditional health and welfare charities,</quotedText>” avoiding the appearance of governmental favoritism of particular groups or viewpoints, and avoiding disruption of the federal workplace by controversy.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080436"/> The Court pinpointed the government’s intention as the key to whether a public forum has been created: “<quotedText>The government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a non-traditional forum for public discourse.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080440"/> Under this categorical approach, the government has wide discretion in maintaining the nonpublic character of its forums, and may regulate in ways that would be impermissible were it to designate a limited public forum.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080444"/></p>
              <p>Application of these principles continues to raise often difficult questions. In <i>United States v. Kokinda</i>, a majority of Justices, who ultimately upheld a ban on soliciting contributions on postal premises under the “reasonableness” review governing nonpublic fora, could not agree on the public forum status of a sidewalk located entirely on postal service property.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854305056"/> Two years later, in <i>International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee</i>, the Court similarly divided as to whether non-secured areas of airport terminals, including shops and restaurants, constitute public fora.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854303168"/> A five-Justice majority held that airport terminals are not public fora and upheld regulations banning the repetitive solicitation of money within the terminals.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854302320"/></p>
              <p> A decade later, the Court considered the public forum status of the Internet. In <i>United States v. American Library Association, Inc.</i>, a four-Justice plurality held that “Internet access in public libraries is neither a ‘traditional’ nor a ‘designated’ public forum.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854299504"/> The plurality therefore did not apply strict scrutiny in upholding the Children’s Internet Protection Act, which provides that a public school or “library may not receive federal assistance to provide Internet access unless it installs software to block images that constitute obscenity or child pornography, and to prevent minors from obtaining access to material that is harmful to them.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854291664"/> </p>
              <p>More recently, in <i>Packingham v. North Carolina</i>, the Court appeared to equate the Internet to traditional public fora like a street or public park. Specifically, Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, observed that, “[w]hile in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear. It is cyberspace—the ‘vast democratic forums of the Internet’ in general, and social media in particular.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854287168"/> Consequently, the Court struck down a North Carolina law making it a felony for registered sex offenders to use commercial social networking websites that allow minor children to be members, such as Facebook. Applying strict scrutiny, the Court held that the North Carolina law impermissibly restricted lawful speech as it was not narrowly tailored to serve the government’s interest in protecting minors from registered sex offenders because it “foreclose[d] access to social media altogether,” thereby “prevent[ing] the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854282640"/></p>

The Supreme Court has not explicitly held that the Internet as a whole is a public forum, but, in <inline role="name" class="case">Reno v.

              <p>The First Amendment precludes government restraint of expression and it does not require individuals to turn over their homes, businesses, or other property to those wishing to communicate about a particular topic.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080460"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854239648"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854237760"/>But it may be that in some instances private property is so functionally akin to public property that private owners may not forbid expression upon it. In <inline role="name" class="case">Marsh v. Alabama</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080464"/> the Court held that the private owner of a company town could not forbid distribution of religious materials by a Jehovah’s Witness on a street in the town’s business district. The town, wholly owned by a private corporation, had all the attributes of any American municipality, aside from its ownership, and was functionally like any other town. In those circumstances, the Court reasoned, “<quotedText>the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080468"/> This precedent lay unused for some twenty years until the Court first indicated a substantial expansion of it, and then withdrew to a narrow interpretation.</p>

Logan Valley Plaza</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080472"/> the Court held constitutionally protected the picketing of a store located in a shopping center by a union objecting to the store’s employment of nonunion labor. Finding that the shopping center was the functional equivalent of the business district involved in <inline role="name" class="case">Marsh</inline>, the Court announced there was “<quotedText>no reason why access to a business district in a company town for the purpose of exercising First Amendment rights should be constitutionally required, while access for the same purpose to property functioning as a business district should be limited simply because the property surrounding the ‘business district’ is not under the same ownership.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080476"/>“<quotedText>[T]he State,</quotedText>” said Justice Marshall, “<quotedText>may not delegate the power, through the use of its trespass laws, wholly to exclude those members of the public wishing to exercise their First Amendment rights on the premises in a manner and for a purpose generally consonant with the use to which the property is actually put.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080480"/> The Court observed that it would have been hazardous to attempt to distribute literature at the entrances to the center and it reserved for future decision “<quotedText>whether respondents’ property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not thus directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080484"/></p>

Center guards invoked a trespass law against them, and the Court held that they could rightfully be excluded. The center had not dedicated its property to a public use, the Court said; rather, it had invited the public in specifically to carry on business with those stores located in the center. Plaintiffs’ leafleting, not directed to any store or to the customers <i xml:lang="la">qua</i> customers of any of the stores, was unrelated to any activity in the center. Unlike the situation in <inline role="name" class="case">Logan Valley Plaza</inline>, there were reasonable alternatives by which plaintiffs could reach those who used the center. Thus, in the absence of a relationship between the purpose of the expressive activity and the business of the shopping center, the property rights of the center owner will overbalance the expressive rights to persons who would use their property to communicate.</p>

The ruling came in a case in which a union of employees engaged in an economic strike against one store in a shopping center was barred from picketing the store within the mall.

Peaceful picketing may be enjoined if it is associated with violence and intimidation.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080520"/> Although initially the Court continued to find picketing protected in the absence of violence,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080524"/> it soon decided a series of cases recognizing a potentially far-reaching exception: injunctions against peaceful picketing in the course of a labor controversy may be enjoined when such picketing is counter to valid state policies in a domain open to state regulation.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080528"/> These cases proceeded upon a distinction drawn by Justice Douglas. “<quotedText>Picketing by an organized group is more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated. Hence those aspects of picketing make it the subject of restrictive regulations.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080532"/> The apparent culmination of this course of decision was the <inline role="name" class="case">Vogt</inline> case, in which Justice Frankfurter broadly rationalized all the cases and derived the rule that “<quotedText>a State, in enforcing some public policy, whether of its criminal or its civil law, and whether announced by its legislature or its courts, could constitutionally enjoin peaceful picketing aimed at preventing effectuation of that policy.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080536"/> Although the Court has not disavowed this broad language, the <inline role="name" class="case">Vogt</inline>exception has apparently not swallowed the entire <inline role="name" class="case">Thornhill</inline>rule.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51854082048"/> The Court has indicated that “<quotedText>a broad ban against peaceful picketing might collide with the guarantees of the First Amendment.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080540"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854162768"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854161456"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51854161040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854159232"/>The early cases held that picketing and parading were forms of expression entitled to some First Amendment protection.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080544"/> Those early cases did not, however, explicate the difference in application of First Amendment principles that the difference between mere expression and speech-plus would entail. Many of these cases concerned disruptions or feared disruptions of the public peace occasioned by the expressive activity and the ramifications of this on otherwise protected activity.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080548"/> A series of other cases concerned the permissible characteristics of permit systems in which parades and meetings were licensed, and expanded the procedural guarantees that must accompany a permissible licensing system.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080552"/> In one case, however, the Court applied the rules developed with regard to labor picketing to uphold an injunction against the picketing of a grocery chain by a black group to compel the chain to adopt a quota-hiring system for blacks. The Supreme Court affirmed the state court's ruling that, although no law prevented the chain from hiring blacks on a quota basis, picketing to coerce the adoption of racially discriminatory hiring was contrary to state public policy.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080556"/></p>

In a series of decisions, the Court refused to permit restrictions on parades and demonstrations, and reversed convictions imposed for breach of the peace and similar offenses, when, in the Court’s view, disturbance had resulted from opposition to the messages being uttered by demonstrators.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080576"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845583504"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845581712"/>Subsequently, however, the Court upheld a ban on residential picketing in <inline role="name" class="case">Frisby v. Shultz</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080580"/> finding that the city ordinance was narrowly tailored to serve the “<quotedText>significant</quotedText>” governmental interest in protecting residential privacy.

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51854161040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854159232"/>In 1982, the Justices confronted a case, that, like <inline role="name" class="case">Hughes v. Superior Court</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080588"/> involved a state court injunction on picketing, although this one also involved a damage award. <inline role="name" class="case">NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080592"/> may join in terms of importance such cases as <inline role="name" class="case">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080596"/> in requiring the states to observe enhanced constitutional standards before they may impose liability upon persons for engaging in expressive conduct that implicates the First Amendment. The case arose in the context of a protest against racial conditions by black citizens of Claiborne County, Mississippi. Listing demands that included desegregation of public facilities, hiring of black policemen, hiring of more black employees by local stores, and ending of verbal abuse by police, a group of several hundred blacks unanimously voted to boycott the area’s white merchants. The boycott was carried out through speeches and nonviolent picketing and solicitation of others to cease doing business with the merchants. Individuals were designated to watch stores and identify blacks patronizing the stores; their names were then announced at meetings and published. Persuasion of others included social pressures and threats of social ostracism. Acts of violence did occur from time to time, directed in the main at blacks who did not observe the boycott.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51854161040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854159232"/>The state Supreme Court imposed joint and several liability upon leaders and participants in the boycott, and upon the NAACP, for all of the merchants’ lost earnings during a seven-year period on the basis of the common law tort of malicious interference with the merchants’ business, holding that the existence of acts of physical force and violence and the use of force, violence, and threats to achieve the ends of the boycott deprived it of any First Amendment protection.</p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51854161040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854159232"/>Reversing, the Court observed that the goals of the boycotters were legal and that most of their means were constitutionally protected; although violence was not protected, its existence alone did not deprive the other activities of First Amendment coverage. Thus, speeches and nonviolent picketing, both to inform the merchants of grievances and to encourage other blacks to join the boycott, were protected activities, and association for those purposes was also protected.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080600"/> That some members of the group might have engaged in violence or might have advocated violence did not result in loss of protection for association, absent a showing that those associating had joined with intent to further the unprotected activities.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080604"/> Nor was protection to be denied because nonparticipants had been urged to join by speech, by picketing, by identification, by threats of social ostracism, and by other expressive acts: “<quotedText>[s]peech does not lose its protected character . . . simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080608"/> The boycott had a disruptive effect upon local economic conditions and resulted in loss of business for the merchants, but these consequences did not justify suppression of the boycott. Government may certainly regulate certain economic activities having an incidental effect upon speech (<i>e.g.</i>, labor picketing or business conspiracies to restrain competition),<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080612"/> but that power of government does not extend to suppression of picketing and other boycott activities involving, as this case did, speech upon matters of public affairs with the intent of affecting governmental action and motivating private actions to achieve racial equality.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080616"/></p>
              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51854161040"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854159232"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854859968"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854863904"/>The critical issue, however, had been the occurrence of violent acts and the lower court’s conclusion that they deprived otherwise protected conduct of protection. “<quotedText>The First Amendment does not protect violence . . . . No federal rule of law restricts a State from imposing tort liability for business losses that are caused by violence and by threats of violence. When such conduct occurs in the context of constitutionally protected activity, however, ‘precision of regulation’ is demanded . . . . Specifically, the presence of activity protected by the First Amendment imposes restraints on the grounds that may give rise to damages liability and on the persons who may be held accountable for those damages.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080620"/> In other words, the states may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, but they may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080624"/> Thus, the state courts had to compute, upon proof by the merchants, what damages had been the result of violence, and could not include losses suffered as a result of all the other activities comprising the boycott. And only those nonviolent persons who associated with others with an awareness of violence and an intent to further it could similarly be held liable.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080628"/> Because most of the acts of violence had occurred early on, in 1966, there was no way constitutionally that much if any of the later losses of the merchants could be recovered in damages.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080632"/> As to the field secretary of the local NAACP, the Court refused to permit imposition of damages based upon speeches that could be read as advocating violence, because any violent acts that occurred were some time after the speeches, and a “<quotedText>clear and present danger</quotedText>” analysis of the speeches would not find them punishable.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080636"/> The award against the NAACP fell with the denial of damages against its local head, and, in any event, the protected right of association required a rule that would immunize the NAACP without a finding that it “<quotedText>authorized – either actually or apparently – or ratified unlawful conduct.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080640"/></p>

In <inline role="name" class="case">Madsen v. Women’s Health Center</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080648"/> the Court refined principles governing issuance of “<quotedText>content-neutral</quotedText>” injunctions that restrict expressive activity.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080652"/> The appropriate test, the Court stated, is “<quotedText>whether the challenged provisions of the injunction burden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant governmental interest.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080656"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854859968"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854863904"/>Regular time, place, and manner analysis (requiring that regulation be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest) “<quotedText>is not sufficiently rigorous,</quotedText>” the Court explained, “<quotedText>because injunctions create greater risk of censorship and discriminatory application, and because of the established principle that an injunction should be no broader than necessary to achieve its desired goals.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080660"/> Applying its new test, the Court upheld an injunction prohibiting protesters from congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating, or entering any portion of the public right-of-way within 36 feet of an abortion clinic. Similarly upheld were noise restrictions designed to ensure the health and well-being of clinic patients. Other aspects of the injunction, however, did not pass the test. Inclusion of private property within the 36-foot buffer was not adequately justified, nor was inclusion in the noise restriction of a ban on “<quotedText>images observable</quotedText>” by clinic patients. A ban on physically approaching any person within 300 feet of the clinic unless that person indicated a desire to communicate burdened more speech than necessary. Also, a ban on demonstrating within 300 feet of the residences of clinic staff was not sufficiently justified, the restriction covering a much larger zone than an earlier residential picketing ban that the Court had upheld.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080664"/></p>

The Court upheld the portion of the injunction that banned “<quotedText>demonstrating within fifteen feet from either side or edge of, or in front of, doorways or doorway entrances, parking lot entrances, driveways and driveway entrances of such facilities</quotedText>” what the Court called “<quotedText>fixed buffer zones.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845440880"/> It struck down a prohibition against demonstrating “<quotedText>within fifteen feet of any person or vehicles seeking access to or leaving such facilities</quotedText>” what it called “<quotedText>floating buffer zones.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845438736"/> The Court cited “<quotedText>public safety and order</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845437264"/> in upholding the fixed buffer zones, but it found that the floating buffer zones “<quotedText>burden more speech than is necessary to serve the relevant governmental interests</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845435488"/> because they make it “<quotedText>quite difficult for a protester who wishes to engage in peaceful expressive activity to know how to remain in compliance with the injunction.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845433904"/> The Court also upheld a “<quotedText>provision, specifying that once sidewalk counselors who had entered the buffer zones were required to ‘cease and desist’ their counseling, they had to retreat 15 feet from the people they had been counseling and had to remain outside the boundaries of the buffer zones.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845431472"/></p>

The Court found the statute to be a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of speech that “<quotedText>reflects an acceptable balance between the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding speakers and the interests of unwilling listeners . . . .</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845415824"/> The restrictions were content-neutral because they regulated only the places where some speech may occur, and because they applied equally to all demonstrators, regardless of viewpoint. Although the restrictions did not apply to all speech, the “<quotedText>kind of cursory examination</quotedText>” that might be required to distinguish casual conversation from protest, education, or counseling is not “<quotedText>problematic.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845413344"/> The law was narrowly tailored to achieve the state’s interests. The eight-foot restriction did not significantly impair the ability to convey messages by signs, and ordinarily allowed speakers to come within a normal conversational distance of their targets. Because the statute allowed the speaker to remain in one place, persons who wished to hand out leaflets could position themselves beside entrances near the path of oncoming pedestrians, and consequently were not deprived of the opportunity to get the attention of persons entering a clinic.</p>

Specifically, the Court held that, to preserve First Amendment rights, targeted measures, such as injunctions, enforcement of anti-harassment ordinances, and use of general crowd control authority, as needed, are preferable to broad, prophylactic measures.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51845399776"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845474272"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854859968"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51854863904"/></p>

We are of the opinion that the purpose to keep the streets clean and of good appearance is insufficient to justify an ordinance which prohibits a person rightfully on a public street from handing literature to one willing to receive it. Any burden imposed upon the city authorities in cleaning and caring for the streets as an indirect consequence of such distribution results from the constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and press.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080688"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845370080"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845368144"/>In <inline role="name" class="case">Talley v.

The basis of the decision is not readily ascertainable. On the one hand, the Court celebrated anonymity. “<quotedText>Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind.

The state’s interest in informing the electorate was “<quotedText>plainly insufficient,</quotedText>” and, although the more weighty interest in preventing fraud in the electoral process may be accomplished by a direct prohibition, it may not be accomplished indirectly by an indiscriminate ban on a whole category of speech.

Although a city’s concern over visual blight could be addressed by an anti-littering ordinance not restricting the expressive activity of distributing handbills, in the case of utility pole signs “<quotedText>it is the medium of expression itself</quotedText>” that creates the visual blight. Hence, the city’s prohibition, unlike a prohibition on distributing handbills, was narrowly tailored to curtail no more speech than necessary to accomplish the city’s legitimate purpose.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080712"/> Ten years later, however, the Court unanimously invalidated a town’s broad ban on residential signs that permitted only residential identification signs, “<quotedText>for sale</quotedText>” signs, and signs warning of safety hazards.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080716"/> Prohibiting homeowners from displaying political, religious, or personal messages on their own property entirely foreclosed “<quotedText>a venerable means of communication that is unique and important,</quotedText>” and that is “<quotedText>an unusually cheap form of communication</quotedText>” without viable alternatives for many residents.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080720"/> The ban was thus reminiscent of total bans on leafleting, distribution of literature, and door-to-door solicitation that the Court had struck down in the 1930s and 1940s.

The five-to-four majority concluded that on balance “<quotedText>[t]he dangers of distribution can so easily be controlled by traditional legal methods, leaving to each householder the full right to decide whether he will receive strangers as visitors, that stringent prohibition can serve no purpose but that forbidden by the Constitution, the naked restriction of the dissemination of ideas.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080748"/></p>

No unifying theory capable of application to a wide range of possible flag abuse actions emerged from the early cases. Thus, in <inline role="name" class="case">Street v.

Washington</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080832"/>which set aside a conviction under a statute punishing the display of a United States flag to which something is attached or superimposed; Spence had hung his flag from his apartment window upside down with a peace symbol taped to the front and back. The act, the Court thought, was a form of communication, and because of the nature of the act, and the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken, the Court held it to be protected. The context included the fact that the flag was privately owned, that it was displayed on private property, and that there was no danger of breach of the peace. The nature of the act was that it was intended to express an idea and it did so without damaging the flag. The Court assumed that the state had a valid interest in preserving the flag as a national symbol, but left unclear whether that interest extended beyond protecting the physical integrity of the flag.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080836"/></p>

Twice, in 1989 and again in 1990, the Court held that prosecutions for flag burning at a public demonstration violated the First Amendment. First, in <inline role="name" class="case">Texas v. Johnson</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080839"/> the Court rejected a state desecration statute designed to protect the flag’s symbolic value, and then in <inline role="name" class="case">United States v. Eichman</inline><ref class="footnote" idref="FN080842"/> rejected a more limited federal statute purporting to protect only the flag’s physical integrity. Both cases were decided by 5-to-4 votes, with Justice Brennan writing the Court’s opinions.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080845"/> The Texas statute invalidated in <inline role="name" class="case">Johnson</inline> defined the prohibited act of “<quotedText>desecration</quotedText>” as any physical mistreatment of the flag that the actor knew would seriously offend other persons. This emphasis on causing offense to others meant that the law was not “<quotedText>unrelated to the suppression of free expression</quotedText>” and that consequently the deferential standard of <inline role="name" class="case">United States v. O’Brien</inline> was inapplicable. <marker role="index" misc="idm51860056832"/>Applying strict scrutiny, the Court ruled that the state’s prosecution of someone who burned a flag at a political protest was not justified under the state’s asserted interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. The Court’s opinion left little doubt that the existing federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 700, and the flag desecration laws of 47 other states would suffer a similar fate in a similar case. Doubt remained, however, as to whether the Court would uphold a “<quotedText>content-neutral</quotedText>” statute protecting the physical integrity of the flag.</p>

The government’s underlying interest, characterized by the Court as resting upon “<quotedText>a perceived need to preserve the flag’s status as a symbol of our Nation and certain national ideals,</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080854"/> still related to the suppression of free expression. Support for this interpretation was found in the fact that most of the prohibited acts are usually associated with disrespectful treatment of the flag; this suggested to the Court “<quotedText>a focus on those acts likely to damage the flag’s symbolic value.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080857"/> As in <inline role="name" class="case">Johnson</inline>, such a law could not withstand “<quotedText>most exacting scrutiny</quotedText>” analysis.<marker role="index" misc="idm51860056832"/></p>

            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51845017952"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845016144"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51858381408"/>The right of petition took its rise from the modest provision made for it in chapter 61 of the Magna Carta (1215).<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080863"/> To this meager beginning are traceable, in some measure, Parliament itself and its procedures for the enactment of legislation, the equity jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, and proceedings against the Crown by “<quotedText>petition of right.</quotedText>” Thus, while the King summoned Parliament for the purpose of supply, the latter – but especially the House of Commons – petitioned the King for a redress of grievances as its price for meeting the financial needs of the Monarch, and as it increased in importance, it came to claim the right to dictate the form of the King’s reply, until, in 1414, Commons declared itself to be “<quotedText>as well assenters as petitioners.</quotedText>” Two hundred and fifty years later, in 1669, Commons further resolved that every commoner in England possessed “<quotedText>the inherent right to prepare and present petitions</quotedText>” to it “<quotedText>in case of grievance,</quotedText>” and of Commons “<quotedText>to receive the same</quotedText>” and to judge whether they were “<quotedText>fit</quotedText>” to be received. Finally Chapter 5 of the Bill of Rights of 1689 asserted the right of the subjects to petition the King and “<quotedText>all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning to be illegal.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080866"/></p>
            <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51845017952"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51845016144"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51858381408"/>Historically, therefore, the right of petition is the primary right, the right peaceably to assemble a subordinate and instrumental right, as if the First Amendment read: “<quotedText>the right of the people peaceably to assemble</quotedText>” in order to “<quotedText>petition the government.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080869"/> Today, however, the right of peaceable assembly is, in the language of the Court, “<quotedText>cognate to those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental. . . . [It] is one that cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions, – principles which the Fourteenth Amendment embodies in the general terms of its due process clause. . . . The holding of meetings for peaceable political action cannot be proscribed. Those who assist in the conduct of such meetings cannot be branded as criminals on that score. The question . . . is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080872"/> Furthermore, the right of petition has expanded. It is no longer confined to demands for “<quotedText>a redress of grievances,</quotedText>” in any accurate meaning of these words, but comprehends demands for an exercise by the government of its powers in furtherance of the interest and prosperity of the petitioners and of their views on politically contentious matters.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080875"/> The right extends to the “<quotedText>approach of citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies (which are both creatures of the legislature, and arms of the executive) and to courts, the third branch of Government. Certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080878"/></p>

Finally on January 28, 1840, the House adopted as a standing rule: “<quotedText>That no petition, memorial, resolution, or other paper praying the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, or any State or Territories of the United States in which it now exists, shall be received by this House, or entertained in any way whatever.</quotedText>” Because of efforts of John Quincy Adams, this rule was repealed five years later.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080881"/> For many years now the rules of the House of Representatives have provided that Members having petitions to present may deliver them to the Clerk and the petitions, except such as in the judgment of the Speaker are of an obscene or insulting character, shall be entered on the Journal and the Clerk shall furnish a transcript of such record to the official reporters of debates for publication in the Record.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080884"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871568560"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51844975952"/> Even so, petitions for the repeal of the espionage and sedition laws and against military measures for recruiting resulted, in World War I, in imprisonment.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080887"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51871568560"/> Processions for the presentation of petitions in the United States have not been particularly successful. In 1894 General Coxey of Ohio organized armies of unemployed to march on Washington and present petitions, only to see their leaders arrested for unlawfully walking on the grass of the Capitol. The march of the veterans on Washington in 1932 demanding bonus legislation was defended as an exercise of the right of petition. The Administration, however, regarded it as a threat against the Constitution and called out the army to expel the bonus marchers and burn their camps. Marches and encampments have become more common since, but the results have been mixed.<marker role="index" misc="idm51845016144"/></p>

              <p><marker role="index" misc="idm51845017952"/><marker role="index" misc="idm51858381408"/>The right of assembly was first before the Supreme Court in 1876<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080890"/> in the famous case of <inline role="name" class="case">United States v. Cruikshank</inline>.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080893"/> The Enforcement Act of 1870<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080896"/> forbade conspiring or going onto the highways or onto the premises of another to intimidate any other person from freely exercising and enjoying any right or privilege granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States. Defendants had been indicted under this Act on charges of having deprived certain citizens of their right to assemble together peaceably with other citizens “<quotedText>for a peaceful and lawful purpose.</quotedText>” Although the Court held the indictment inadequate because it did not allege that the attempted assembly was for a purpose related to the Federal Government, its <i>dicta</i> broadly declared the outlines of the right of assembly. “<quotedText>The right of the people peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or for anything else connected with the powers or the duties of the National Government, is an attribute of national citizenship, and, as such, under the protection of, and guaranteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances. If it had been alleged in these counts that the object of the defendants was to prevent a meeting for such a purpose, the case would have been within the statute, and within the scope of the sovereignty of the United States.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080899"/> Absorption of the assembly and petition clauses into the liberty protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment means, of course, that the <inline role="name" class="case">Cruikshank</inline>limitation is no longer applicable.<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080902"/></p>

Justice Roberts, in an opinion that Justice Black joined and with which Chief Justice Hughes concurred, found protection against state abridgment of the rights of assembly and petition in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. “<quotedText>The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080908"/> Justices Stone and Reed invoked the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for the result, thereby claiming the rights of assembly and petition for aliens as well as citizens. “<quotedText>I think respondents’ right to maintain it does not depend on their citizenship and cannot rightly be made to turn on the existence or non-existence of a purpose to disseminate information about the National Labor Relations Act. It is enough that petitioners have prevented respondents from holding meetings and disseminating information whether for the organization of labor unions or for any other lawful purpose.</quotedText>”<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080911"/> This due process view of Justice Stone's has carried the day over the privileges and immunities approach.<marker role="index" misc="idm51844929664"/></p>

While certain conduct may still be denominated as either petition<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080914"/> or assembly<ref class="footnote" idref="FN080917"/> rather than speech, there seems little question that similar standards will be applied in most cases.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51856387264"/> For instance, as discussed earlier, where a public employee sues a government employer under the First Amendment’s Speech Clause, the employee must show that he or she spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51843553632"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">Borough of Duryea, Pennsylvania v. Guarnieri</inline>,<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51843549344"/> the Court similarly held that a police chief who alleged retaliation for having filed a union grievance challenging his termination was not protected by the right to petition, because his complaints did not go to matters of public concern.<ref class="footnote" idref="idm51843548000"/></p>

Justice Holmes dissented. “<quotedText>If what I think the correct test is applied, it is manifest that there was no present danger of an attempt to overthrow the government by force on the part of the admittedly small minority who shared the defendant’s views. It is said that this manifesto was more than a theory, that it was an incitement. Every idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief and if believed it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth. The only difference between the expression of an opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker’s enthusiasm for the result. Eloquence may set fire to reason. But whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us it had no chance of starting a present conflagration. If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.</quotedText>” Id. at 673.</p>

        <p>The dissenters, Justices Stevens, Brennan, and Powell, believed that the Constitution protects the public’s right to be informed about conditions within the prison and that total denial of access, such as existed prior to institution of the suit, was unconstitutional. They would have sustained the more narrowly drawn injunctive relief to the press on the basis that no member of the public had yet sought access. <inline role="citation">438 U.S. at 19</inline>. It is clear that Justice Stewart did not believe that the Constitution affords any relief. Id. at 16. Although the plurality opinion of the Chief Justice Burger and Justices White and Rehnquist may be read as not deciding whether any public right of access exists, overall it appears to proceed on the unspoken basis that there is none. The second question, when Justice Stewart’s concurring opinion and the dissenting opinion are combined, appears to be answerable qualifiedly in the direction of constitutional constraints upon the nature of access limitation once access is granted.</p>

        <p>Commercial speech is viewed by the Court as usually hardier than other speech; because advertising is the <i xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> of commercial profits, it is less likely to be chilled by regulation. Thus, the difference inheres in both the nature of the speech and the nature of the governmental interest. <inline role="name" class="case">Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council</inline>, <inline role="citation">425 U.S. 748, 771-72 n.24 (1976)</inline>; <inline role="name" class="case">Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n</inline>, <inline role="citation">436 U.S. 447, 455-56 (1978)</inline>. It is, of course, important to develop distinctions between commercial speech and other speech for purposes of determining when broader regulation is permissible. The Court’s definitional statements have been general, referring to commercial speech as that “<quotedText>proposing a commercial transaction,</quotedText>”<inline role="name" class="case">Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n</inline>, <i>supra</i>, or as “<quotedText>expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.</quotedText>”<inline role="name" class="case">Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. PSC</inline>, <inline role="citation">447 U.S. 557, 561 (1980)</inline>.

Public Service Comm’n</inline>, <inline role="citation">447 U.S. 530 (1980)</inline>.

By contrast, a mixing of home economics information with a sales pitch at a “<quotedText>Tupperware</quotedText>” party did not remove the transaction from commercial speech. <inline role="name" class="case">Board of Trustees v.

The California Supreme Court ruled that the suit could proceed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari, but then dismissed it as improvidently granted, with a concurring and two dissenting opinions. The issue left undecided was whether Nike’s statements, though they concerned a matter of public debate and appeared in press releases and letters rather than in advertisements for its products, should be deemed “<quotedText>'commercial speech’ because they might affect consumers’ opinions about the business as a good corporate citizen and thereby affect their purchasing decisions.</quotedText>” Id. at 657 (Stevens, J., concurring).

A candidate who, for example, seeks to further his cause through the prominent display of his wife and children can hardly argue that his qualities as a husband or father remain of ‘purely private’ concern. And the candidate who vaunts his spotless record and sterling integrity cannot convincingly cry ‘Foul’ when an opponent or an industrious reporter attempts to demonstrate the contrary. . . . Given the realities of our political life, it is by no means easy to see what statements about a candidate might be altogether without relevance to his fitness for the office he seeks. The clash of reputations is the staple of election campaigns and damage to reputation is, of course, the essence of libel. But whether there remains some exiguous area of defamation against which a candidate may have full recourse is a question we need not decide in this case.</quotedText>”</p>

It protects advocacy of the opinion that adultery may sometimes be proper no less than advocacy of socialism or the single tax. And in the realm of ideas it protects expression which is eloquent no less than that which is unconvincing.</quotedText>” Id. at 688-89.</p>

Similar rules apply to regulation of cable TV. In <inline role="name" class="case">Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v.

The segregate-and-block restrictions, which included a requirement that a request for access be in writing, and which allowed for up to 30 days’ delay in blocking or unblocking a channel, were not sufficiently protective of adults’ speech and viewing interests to be considered either narrowly or reasonably tailored to serve the government’s compelling interest in protecting children.<marker role="index" misc="idm51860056832"/> In <inline role="name" class="case">United States v.

Presumably the <inline role="name" class="case">Barnes</inline> plurality’s public-morality rationale would apply equally to the “<quotedText>adult</quotedText>” stage and to the operatic theater, while Justice Souter’s secondary effects rationale would not. But the plurality ducked this issue, reinterpreting the lower court record to deny that Indiana had distinguished between “<quotedText>adult</quotedText>” and theatrical productions. 501 U.S. at 564 n.1 (Chief Justice Rehnquist); id. at 574 n.2 (Justice Scalia). On the other hand, the fact that the state authorities disclaimed any intent to apply the statute to theatrical productions demonstrated to dissenting Justice White (who was joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens) that the statute was <i>not</i> a general prohibition on public nudity, but instead was targeted at “<quotedText>the communicative aspect of the erotic dance.</quotedText>” Id. at 591.</p>
